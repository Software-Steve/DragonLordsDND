Welcome. These are my notes from the 5e DND module odyssey of the dragon lords.  For my group, keep in mind that these notes are somewhat written from merrics point of view but also somewhat from the view of the table. For any random strangers that may see this public repo. Know that my notes are very specific to our journey and should in no way reflect how this campaign will play out for you. 

I would also like to shout out to the great players and even greater DM. DM Matt marsh was able to take this story and make it come alive.
