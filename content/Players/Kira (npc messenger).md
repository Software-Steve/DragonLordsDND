Kira got really drunk at our welcome party. She was very happy for us and enjoyed the festivities.

kira reinforced eira that failure is not always bad. She told the story of how a gnome kept trying and trying to defet his nemisis. He failed over and over. It was not that he was a failure it was that he kept trying so he never failed.

She shared with eira  a poem at night. She knew it was bad but wanted eiras honest opinion.

We notice that kira has some symbols on her face that we had not seen before. Did not get an idea of where from or what they are.

the oracle chaning form as the oracle askes her why she still pretending and that she is the goddess of music who was watching. The oracle warns that the pact she made is binding and while fate changes her actions had consequences. The goddess vowes to continue on and protect people. The oracle warns her that she may overstep her bounds.

her mother is mitros. who is dead.

her sister is vallase. The goddes of wisdom. She has her own plans after the oath is over.

her father, vulcan seems to be preoccupited and not intrested in the war

kira hates her brother for being cowerdly and he hates her from some "stupid and rash".

kira plays to a huge crowd as we meet back up. Everyone is very impressed with her performance (35)

She tells us that infact she was the one who created the oath and that resulted in the killing of / exhile of his mother. Not everyone agreed with her but it happend. She is working on improving herself and stands by her decision.

her father kinda hates her and seems to blame her for her mothers death. He belittles her for every little thing and kina disproves of us fighting with her.

She is terrified of the stone hands in the valley. She has nightmares about it. Seemingly something to do with the war. Vulcan offers no assistance  but says that it will likely just take a while before she fells alright.

when merric helped infuse his power into kira he notice that on her shoulder  , for a brief second, appeard to be dragon like scales. 

  
As we walk in on kira  at the hotel we notice that on her back seems to be a tatoo of  some azure wings merric starts to think that she may be a dragon but isnt gonna ask.
