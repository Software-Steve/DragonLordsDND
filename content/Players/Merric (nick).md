the oracle tells me that i have been blown here. The objects i seek are here in thylea a shooting star. She also sees a heart with darkness surronding it. It may be in the posesion of __lutheria__ be wary if i get them all together.

I had a dream once apon this fortnight (session 4) an evil voice reaches out to me in my sleep. Just as i get all my charms together the heart is missing. They warn him of the troubles getting them together may cause. she starts to crush the heart figure and merric feels very sad for some reason as he sees a woman crying as she crushed the charm.

I have a dream of lutheria taunting a charm in front of me. She says i shall suffer. I and the unknown person in my lucky charm. lsdfkjlasd;jf;lasdjff
