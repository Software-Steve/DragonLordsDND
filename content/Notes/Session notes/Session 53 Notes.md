We take a short rest to gather ourselves. [[Kadeem (steve)]] [[Helios (matt)]] and [[Balthor (Chase)]] all talk/think about what is in store ahead. [[Kadeem (steve)]] tells us about how the founding of estroia was. It was a bloody and tumultuous affair. The true history is not meant to be known and people such as the king tried people for treason.  We get to riding closer after our rest.

[[Kadeem (steve)]] and [[Balthor (Chase)]] fail to hold onto their horse. [[kallik (rhyse)]] also fails to hold onto his. [[Eira (emily)]] catches up to [[kallik (rhyse)]] s horse. She also katches up to [[Kadeem (steve)]] s horse but it freaked out and died. We decide to head out the rest of the way on foot because the horses are freeaked out by the area.  

We find an area with columns. They are faces of all the races and sexes on the columns. 

7 faces, all distinct M F F M F M F . That pattern repeats down the column. In descending order we have an obsidian eye, crown with black antlers, a pciture of a dragon, silver anvil, a hammer with 5 stars.

1. cidron
2. luteria
3. mitros
4. vulcan
5. valas
6. pythor
7. kara

the faces are screaming in terror and fear. Dieties are screaming in pain and agony.
