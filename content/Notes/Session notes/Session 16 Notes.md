We sleep finally as our long day ends. Balthor wakes up and mind melds with kara. he sees some sort of creature that is coverd in arms. He fears the creature. He just beats the save. He feels calm afterwords like he is in the presence of some motherly figure. It appears to be fate. She has come to him. She speaks to him telling him that "this place is not for you goddess" ( in kiras mind). From her mind he gets that he is looking at the physical manifestaion of the creature that seperates thylea from the rest of the world. Some of kiras extended wounds start to dissapear/ retract. 

He tries to cast clarvoyance but nothing happens. He wakes merric wo tries to identify and detect his magic. He finds very little magic about him and almost none in him. He tries to remember and recalls that we saw a picture yesterday of a titan with a bunch of arms. He believes that they have pushed his patron out of thylea. 

We go to the library

Merric reads a book about captain hypothalamous . His journal as his travels on the sea sprite on departure from waterdeep. Close to the end, he says he sailed out of waterdeep bound for baulders gate. He didnt know what happened but ran into a mythical storm. He then landed ashore in thylea of which he knows nothing of it. he explores the land a bit. On the final page he talks about cideron astor of storms and want to speek to him in order to perhaps make their way back home. 

We go to the bar with helios, kalik, and balthor. Merric runs his mouth to some of the old dwars saying that we are the heros of the oracle and that kalli is a master forge smith and helios is in contorl of the hammer of pythor. They believe kalik is a good forge and helios defets the leader in an arm wrestling contest. They agree to show our group the way. 

go to the great falls of arkelon to the north of the city. Once there we must find the path. I
