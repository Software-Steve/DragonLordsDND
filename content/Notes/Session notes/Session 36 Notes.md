Kadems family leaves with kara to go to helios's home town. I ask kara if she thinks the king will do anything crazy. She thinks its not out of the ordinary. She also says that this is the first time the cult of luteria has ever tried anything crazy like this. She does not see the king as her brother in law rather just a man. in a bit of foreshadowing she says she will likely tell everyone how the heros of the oracle managed to catch the slave trader and follower of luteria that we defeated in battle. 

balthor sees a spy for the queen valas. he says he will meet with us at the inn. 

we decide to get dinner at the restraunt. 

we go back to the room and meet laharal who is not from thylea. he washed up here and has agreed to locat people that wash up on the shores of thylea. He tries to help castaways when he can. He is part of the organization of the lost. Wings of the lost WOTL. He has reached out to kara on occasion as she is open to helping more then the other "gods". Merric inferrs that he means to say that he dosent like any of the 5 gods or the titans.  

He tells us that its possible someone is backing the king and that some magic is helping with the dragons. icarus may have helped. he notes that the silver dragons arent known for being so greedy. Helios notes that gaius rode in on a silver dragon female. Icarus is a male silver dragon.
