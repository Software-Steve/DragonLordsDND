We enter the mythral forge. We are greeted by a strange fire creature who wants us to release her from the forger. She is being used by and hates the dwarves for imprisionging her in there using her life force to sustain the forge for all eternity. She says she can light the forge but wont work for dwarves anymore. She talks to kallik. she says she has seen others like kallik. They went down the far passage. She didnt know them but knows they were smart and didnt let them out.

We step to investiate the device in the corner in order to tell how to dismantle the magic. As we do we have to fight a giant serberous. it has a weird goat creature on its back and a black gooey scroll in its mouth. we all nearly end up dead. Merrik is knocked out. Right as the dog kills kadem and balthor. Merric rolls a nat 20 and gets up casting a magic misile hitting each head killing the dog for 19 damage.
