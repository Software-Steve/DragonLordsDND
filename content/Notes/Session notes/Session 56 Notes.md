We end up getting into a skuffle with the first mate. He is drawing up maps. We talk to him a bit. He dosen't know anything about choosing a new captain or anything about beraying the current captain.  Merric decides to push the issue by looking in the captains chest. The first mate attacks. We quicly stop him. 

We go up to meet the current captain. He offers the position to balthor, as his successor. We are unsure about his phrasing but balthor does become captain. We decide to camp out the night on the ship. 




The ship tells us that the anticatharion was create for the ultros so that during the war, the 5 could still navigate to islands even when cydron was at odds with them. After the war, the anticitharion was taken by kara and given to valis because the mistrust and animosity to estor. 

We dock at mitros and are greeted with a crowd. 


we talk to valas . we catch up. She tells us that we have many journeys to the islands among the forgotten sea. There is a missing piece to the anticatherion. Gaius has a piece to the antion. He is on the island of yonder. The queen tells us that the ship traveld as far as the borders of thylea. He said he created the boat himself through his own wrath, cunning, and power. Valas didnt believe him, she thinks it was created with magic beyond his means. 

We also talk about the neather sea. It is the domain of lutheria. We tell valas and kara that we could see into the barrier into the nether sea. They are consirned because there should have been more barriers. They grow conserned. Kara dashes away and returns with versai the oracle. They want to know exactly how long before the oath is over. She says it is "many moons and months before the oath is over". Kara is skeptical and ask her to re-check. After a moment, she returns and says 60 days.
