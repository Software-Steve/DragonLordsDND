We meet pekon who was shot down from his bird form by balthy. Temok tries to threaten him into telling him she sent him. balthor understands that it is valas. While he is speaking I notice that he is paying close attention to kara. Merrik tells her that "he seems to be watching you in particular" . I look in his pocket of proof. It looks like a madalian of a golden laurel wreith. Looks like it should go on a chain on his neck.

Kara is annoyed that valis, her sister, wants to know whats going on. She is concerned about what the messenger is going to tell her sister. Kira and helios talk about it and kara is just annoyed that her sister is just budding in and not actually intending to do any real work for it.

We get to the touchie hands. We are able to get through them sucessfully despite our reservatons about them. we continue up the mountain. 

We fight an endless horde of zombies in mist. At first we think that its just some zombies but they keep coming as long as we are in the mist. We have to run and make hast (ha) out of it. For several hundreds come alive. We have to scale a cliff to get out of there. 

Further up we fight some harpies. Kadem once again gets charmed and almost plumets off a cliff. However kallik spear fishes him from the edge. We defeat them and continue on our way.
