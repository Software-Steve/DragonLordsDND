Kara tells us that she created and wrote what is behind the invisable wall. She didnt want helios to change the way he thought of her. She reviels that she did it all. We assure her that we dont have to go if she doesnt want to go. She thinks thats its important to see it. We do end up going and we see two pillars in an eternally lit room. We see a shining spear , a golden helmate. We see that the words written as celestial. The words "Conquest and arrogence leads to failure....." Kara tells us that she is actually karashal the goddess of conquest and celebration. 

She shows us a flashback. We see pythor, kara, her sister, her mother and others. Kira is emphatic that they make a huge strike against lutheria and sydron. The chorus warns that she is being arrogant and that people WILL die needlessly. She sets out to prove them that her plan is worth while. 

We Fast forward seemingly to her and her musical accompaniment as she starts to test what i suspect is the song of 'creation'. The marching is defening. A woman in a cloak is standing watching. an older man with black armor. We see his armor has a spiral of 10 hands. He tells her to please not proceed they cant stop her but they know that the land wont survive. 

we fast forward again and we just see a woman with green hair. She thought that this was the hold out of the titans but instead its just this couple.  Kara stabs the woman with the green hair. A mass of hands grabbing all of the army are everywhere. Something went wrong. This is seemingly her nightmare.  

She tells us thats how she regretted her actions that day. She gave up her posers to one of the fates who helped prevent her downfall and it was then that the oath was swarn. only after she screwed up. 856K people died that day. Vulcan was never the same. Valis lost hope, and pythor dosent want to fight any more. 

We deside to leave. As we do merric and balthor get into a contest of words which makes kara laugh. 

Merric tells the group we should write a play about our experiences. 

As we jump off the mountain we see a bunch of dragons. a copper and 2 bronze. They burn off the mist of the mountain where we fought the zombies.  they circle and land in front of us. Everyone but merric knows that recently that some dragons are coming back to metros. They are being ridden by red cloaked knights. THey are centurian guards from mytros. They hop down and start approaching us. 

Tarchon introduces himself who says he comes to us as a lige of akastu king of mytros. We great him in very typical us fashion which leaves him bewildered. He wants to get us back to mytros ASAP. they agree to take us to vulcan as long as we
