We come to our senses and kira is very concerned for us. We all had the same vision and talk about it. Kira tells us that she knows the ship. It was put under a curse because it was the flagship of estor (the dragon lord?). she tells us no one has seen it but maybe king acostus will know.

This device in our hands is called the anticithira. It is fortold that it is a mythical compass can navigate all waters even supernatural and we will likely need it for our journey.

We begin our journey home after kara delt with the druid(see notes). Kadem finds our way out.

Giaus demands that we come out of the forrest and pledge our allignce to cideron. Merric challanges gaius as he does not want to bow down before gaius. We fight him and nearly loose but he was called away on duty to cideron as a grey dragon picks him up. 

mistress kira saves us from gaius as she charges into battle. she seems very exhausted and seems to have more marks against her showing on her forehead. 

she telleports us back to our room in town. Kallik and helios go to consult a blacksmith and return the horn. Kira tells eira that the silver dragon is unfortunate and is a decendant of a dragon lord. Her name is argyn. She was raised by cidron and theirfor wants to follow his discord.
