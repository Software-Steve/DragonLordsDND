We leave vulcan's forge and head to estoria. As we arrive in town we see that kadeems wife was busy at work growing alot of trees. Too many trees. Trees growing in houses, on the wall, tearing up foundations and causing havvoc. We meet up with python who is training with some (somewhat scrawney looking ) people. He gives them the advice of "just hit them so hard they cant recover". We find out that his program is meant for giants.  Python asks kadeem to please stop his wife from making trees everywhere. 

kadeem and his wife meet up. Kadeem wisks her off her feet and flys them around the city on a floating bench. He asks her to maybe chill on the plants. They are happy. 

Kallik , eira and balthor go to visit the gnome. He gives kallik money for his notes. He then gives him 3 new potions : one poison, one hill giant strength and one colored water. The gnome noticed that balthor changed since last time he saw him. Balthor mentioned that he changed since fate changed. He doesent like that and asks him to leave. They all eventuall leave. 

We all meet up and have lunch with pythor and anora. We tell them some of our stories. Pythor is proud of helios, surprised with his sisters. 

We leave and head out on the trail to the ultros. We get about half way there and set camp for the night. Balthor and kallik see some spirits off in the distance. Nothing bad happens that night. Balthor tells us the next morning it was his uncle saying they have things to talk about.

We head out the next day we make it a good distance. We then find some fog. We go into it. Balthor charges in. We move in. We get met with some specters. They fight us. One takes over kallik and one takes over merric. He almost fireballs himself to death.
