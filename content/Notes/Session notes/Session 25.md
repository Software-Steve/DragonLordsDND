We come to a bridge. It looks old but seems safe. Dosent look like anyone has crossed it in a while. I take a look and it seems as though there are some footprints somewhat recently across this bridge. It is bi-pedal hoof shaped. It looks like a minotaur has crossed. We meet the bridge keeper. For merric, he just held his hand out merric gave him a coin, a speer, and a piece of his journal. He did not want any of these objects. Merric asked the rest of the party. Kadem rememberd we were given a token by the oracles helpers. Merric checked his bag and found the token. he gave it to the man. Kadem called out to him and we were able to know kinda who he was in life.

Inside the temple He warns us to not disrespect the temple as it is his job to protect it. We search the different crypts.

The bridge keeper we meet. Kadem knows him because of his past. He warns kadem decendant of agathon. He warns kadem and all of us not to mess with the temple. He also warns kadem that lutheria is dangerous and will want kadems blood.

we get to the first tomb. Telemok of something. we see a warrior defeting all kinds of foes. tearing them appart with his bear hands. also carved there is "a punished fool who does not deserved to be rememberd" . Given what we know, bathor knows this has not been consecrated.

We get to the next toumb. We get to the oathswarn of pythor. Most beautifle of the dragon lords. If but his sword work was as beautiful. adonis nerdigon. There is emphisis on his beauty rather then his abilities in combat.

next tomb. Estora archlander. We cant make out swarn of section. Weapons carved out some sections of  the inscription. Kallik is able to see that it said oath swarn of kyrahshal. We see disturbing images of a man destroying dryands and other creaters. His dragon companion begs for mercy for other innocents.

We see the tomb or rizon phobas oathswarn of vulcan. It is murals of battles. A heroic warior beating minitaurs. Minator skeletons are magic holding them in place

We see cosmo phobas's tomb son of rizon phobas. We notice that the floors and walls are covered in an oily substance that seem to move. The crypt keeper warns us of the questions we ask the black ooze that is there. Seemingly because it is cosmos tortured soul.

nicholas phobas blessed of sideron. This tomb is the nicest. He wears a brestplate with the symbol of sideron lord of the storms.

we come to the next tomb. It says issador horath. An athletic woman of regal bearing. always accompanied by a figure in a similar cloak as damon the crypt keeper.

Myrto the magnificent. Two magnificent statues apear. He is depected as a man of huge wealth.

Gregor horath this is empty. The mural and paintings show a man traversing the islands of thylea

Dorian neurdagon: soot darkens the floor and ceiling of this crypt. It has been left ajar.

We see an 8 foot tall minituar come out of the tomb. He is weilding an axe and a shield. This is a white marbel tomb it has a bunch of weatherd columns. This seplcur is blocked by things. The name zandar is on this tomb. Everything seems somewhat damaged. I dont know how long ago.

In one crypt I found a fake wall

We kinda piss off the protector when Merric starts talking to one of the dragon lords who is now a black ooze. He told us that this is as it should be and we should not disturb it.

A minotar wielding a bunch of weapons passes by us. He talks us for a second. When he leaves he attacks balthor. We fight him. Right as we down him, he falls into a tomb. He gets up and starts to run away. As he does so merric tries to get some luck back but bad luck does happen. He ends up telleporting back to the base of the mountain.
