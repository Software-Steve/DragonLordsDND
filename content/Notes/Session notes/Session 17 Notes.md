We deciede to wake kira up. Shhe is very discombobulated and dosnet even know what day it is. She tells balthor not to speak of the thing he saw in her mind. She tells us that the land is deliberatly seperated by some omnipitant being. She was asleep but she did push balthors god out of thylea severing his bond to her. (thus the lack of magic). Kira tells merric she is somewhat doubious about how merric got here and said it was "curious" because iras story she had heard before. 

Helios asks kira why the marks were there. He assumed that they were from her breaking the oath. However she says that they were from a deal she made with the fates. 

That name is kantame. We cannot do anything to it. not by lack of trying, but like, its impossible. He is the father titan. he is more powerful then the rest. He could and would destroy the entire world if he actually got mad. He has gotten mad before but generally he is not interested in the squables. 

Merric identifies the stick. This is called eminars end. it is a wand with one charge. Its magic can prevent identify. It does not want to be known. It does have to be attuned. Kira is concerned and takes it away. She appears to know the shop owner and warns kallik of doing theses things. His family was cursed with unending curiosity and shallow morals. 

"oath: I am, my name, swear to uphold friendship to "

merric gets caught laughing at pythor saying that his magic have gotten bigger. 

follow the stream of the arcon river to the falls. The great falls are close to the mythral hall. the old road next to the river on the map is close to. He also gives us some guide posts. He says that balthor can do this. Look out for magic as merric can probably find it. Once on this magical old path follow it till we get to the great falls. We must find the great passway ( need to find a cliffside that is cut out Look at the western side of the cliff. Look for anything dwarvish. It may be weatherd)
