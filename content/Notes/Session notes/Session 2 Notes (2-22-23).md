We went back to the town and were bet with a heros welcome. we got our free drinks and food. Had a great time with everyone. Merric helped balthor tell the tale of the boar. kadeem sang a song about the boar. We left the next morning with a hung over kira to venture to the oracle. Our first days travel was uneventful. The next day we left and quickly got to the oracle. Merric careleesly cast feather fall to decend the cliff to the oracle. we had to fight some steam enemies as we decend. we beat them easily. after landing, we sighted some bad guys standing outside the oracle room.

we attempt to go find them and cross the river. Merric is carried by helios, Kallik falls in but kira helps him back up. as soon as we go across we are met by the cultist. Merric introduced himself and they immediatly thought to attack us.
