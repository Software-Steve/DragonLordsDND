Balthor seems to know the way to estoria since he is familiar with the area.

We start out on a nice bright sunny day. However we hear a bunch of thunder in the distance. In a matter of minutes we are enveloped by a near tornado. With kallik nearly falying away in the storm eira saves him. Merric cast floating disk and eira puts him on and merric starts walking. The team enters a tunnel that was made by magic that merric detected. Blthor noted that it was put here for storms and for travelers.

we all get cozy and talk. Helios and balthor note that this is not a normal strom. She tells us to be wary of the gods as they may gear up for war after the oath is over which could be soon.

around 1:00 we decide to keep going as the storm has died down. around 8:00 pm the storm has stopped completly. We start looking for shelter it takes B an hour to find a place because he did bad.

We spend the night in the tiny hut.

the voice that spoke to me in my dreams calls to us as we wake up. "what can we do to make you worry less" a man infront of us on a path. A man in front of us has no eyes, mouth or face. THEN WE WAKE UP.
