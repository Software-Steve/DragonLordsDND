We are still on the sea bound for the island. Merric shares his boots with eira so that she can get him and her in secretly. We start to discuss strategy. Helios has the thought of goading gaius out and confronting him alone. Kallik has the thought of using the infinite ghost box and bring that and throwing it like a grenade. Consensues is that its unlikely that gaius will likely face us alone or be easily tricked or fight that honerably even for him. Its still probably better to keep the element of surprise. We also think using the ghost box that is filled with gigans is probably not good to release on an island that houses the few remaining gigans. 

Balthor, kadeem, and helios go to investigate who is intruding in on the captains quarters. It turned out to be the onboard cartographer.  He is an old bird man that gives them a map to the island. 

We all gather in the captains cabin to talk strategy. We decide that we will make landfall on the north western side of the island. Eira and merric will fly out at night and try to locate the object. They will report back with any abnormalities. 

We also hit a snag as the crew gets very confused as the ultros stops itself. Merric explains to edima that the ship can do it itself and is sentient. Merric tries to get the ultros to talk to edima. It refuses. Kadeem awakwardly comes downstairs to try to avoid having the conversation as a whole. Helios cautions against it. Kadeem keeps trying to play a game of shiny keys to avoid the converstaion. balthor decides to not play the hand to edima just yet but assures her that its handled.

Balthor and kadeem make an effort to make it seem like balthor is the one that is controling the magic on the ship

Balthor tries to make himself known as the captain and get aquainted with the crew and the ship.
