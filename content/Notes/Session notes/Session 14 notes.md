We meet with the tree lady and talk with her about our situation. Merric proposes a toast (in order to splash the wine to know if he can drink it) and she starts her monolog.

She condems us for siding with the oracle. She hates the dragon lords for doing bad things to her family. She gets angry but says that is good to talk it out. Merric does not beleive her intentions are as innocent as she wants us to believe.

She tells us that she wants vengance and to retake the hollyland (on a grand crucade) and to return all the titans to rule for all time with impunity.

kadem plays some music. Merric and blhy steal the horn and gets another charm. He got a charm that gives him more luck by his dad. 

as we drink from the horn we find our selves on a gally. We look down at a strange bronze device in my hands. i can see the reflection of the constelations in the sky althogh it is day. men are rowing a boat in a sea of bodies.
