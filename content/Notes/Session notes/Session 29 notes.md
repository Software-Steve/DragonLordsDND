We are riding the dragons. Merric asks kadem if he is going to write a song about this adventure. He says yes. He asks balthor if this is a trap and if we think we have to assasinate the king. Wonders what the folowers of sidron will have with us at mytros. Balthy and kallik investigae the dragons because they dont seem right. He asks balthor again if there is a cult or something to worry about and he says there is a temple that is fairly new. We see as a thunderstorm created by sydron. 

This storm almost took us all down, just me kadem and balthor are left up after the thunder strikes. We book it to the thrown room. It appears we have been expected. We make it to the throne room. We see a woman that looks like kara, a soldgier in a surlian cloak, a tefling in a cloak and finly dressed maden. 

King acustuses head smiles as he us. He tells us he nees our advice/ councel. He needs to know how to placate the lord of the storms sydron. The tiefling sneers at us. The maden eyes are glaring at us. She is glaring at kara. 

Condrus is here from the cult of lutheria (the tiefling) . Commander gaius from sidron. And bella someone who works here. She provides "services" to the king. 

Gaius tells the kin that he must dismantle the temple of the dragon lords (false gods). 

I have heard of a wizard that was in waterdeep to control the weather and combat the storms in order for boats to come and leave freely. He was very successful in his attempts to do so. I know that he was old and well respected. Probably outside of my reach currently. 

Vallas kinda chews me out for casting detect magic but i continue to do so anyway. She and kara have words. King is a decendant of estor.
