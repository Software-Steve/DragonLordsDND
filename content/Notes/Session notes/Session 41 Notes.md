After defeating the vampiers in very epic ways. We head back to town. As we start heading back corpses look at us. Merric fireballes them. balthor cleanse up the survivors with eldritch blast. As we watch the animated corpses die we all fall into lutherias trance once again. For merric she is toying with him as she says she will destroy his charm that she has. 

  
Merric snaps out of the trance as balthor feeds his lucky clover with a level 2 spell. Kallik was the only one originally not affected. It seems we all lived our own personal nightmare from her. 

  
We decide to head back to town. We catch some sleep at the town mayors house we plan a bit and then go to bed without instance

The mayor gives us a small reword (20gp to helios) he also asks us to go deliver a note to tobaius ( the town guard surgon general). the mayor wishes to get a letter delivered to the king who he sees has let him down. He thinks the guard/surgons esteeem will provoke a better response. We tell him we will deliver it then head back to town. 

We drop our horses off at the stable and leave them there for 1 gp a week as we will be back. We then go back to the hotel to meet up with kira.
