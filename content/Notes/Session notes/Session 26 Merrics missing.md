The main group tries to follow the minotar. Helios and kalik follow. They make it to a door. Kadem and balthy soon catch up after a spell wears off on them. Helios is just barely able to get the door open kadem and balthor go through. They see a monument put up and continue to look for the minator.

Meanwhile kira meets up with merric on the mountain. She is still terrified and experiencing nightmares. Merric makes a wall so she cant see whats behind her. They get to the mist and kara is very much falling back into a trance. Merric gives her a good (nat 20) pep talk. " We are ment to be hear on this journey and that through friendship we can continue.

We make it through the rest of the mountain and get back with the rest of the group. We open the next door. We go through the tomb in chase of the minatar. We go through some sort of maze. We fight some bone creatures and undead minotars. We follow the blood through the maze. We ambush some other creatures. We get somewhat close to the end (we think) where helios enters a room. The room starts a trap. he almost gets crushed. Through his, and kiras strength they open and crush the door. Luckily kadem (nat 20) gets kira to snap out of her stooper again.
