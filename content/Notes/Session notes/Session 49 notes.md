bulbug and a cultist ( brother richard \[dick\[) comes to our room to tell us how he is going to kill us in the battle tomorrow. He asks if we can just take it on the chin. We get the thought that he is being controlled. Next morning we go to the games master and tell him what bulbug told us. He brings him in and almost kills him for confirming his programming. Valis comes in and dispells the mind magic on him. Brother dick is nowhere to be found. We find out its been atleast since we took on people at the slave market. He agrees to help us win. In the fight he easily takes out the cultist and we take a solid victory.
