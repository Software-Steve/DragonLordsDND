We land at night. We discuss strategy for a bit then we decide to head into the moutains. EIRA notices that patrols do come through once per day but it looks like they came today. 

We proceed forward as a group, and come to the base of the mountain. There is a guard shack there with sentinels on watch, although lackadaisically.  We go around them without detection easily enough. 

We hike up the steep part of the mountain . We do have to use some magic as the scared craig of a rockface that makes up this mountain makes it difficult to travers. Merric rides on/with kallik. Eira carrys kadeem up, and balthor and helios fly up. We briefly talk about how this may be a good place to split up but balthor and kadeem are both against it. we descend the mountain and meet up at the bottom

We decide that this is a good place to split up. Eira and merric, and kadeem - helios - baltor - and kallik on the other. Kadeem and baltor cast invisibility on merric and eira right after merric casts locate object. About 2 miles out from the giant iron doors he gets a ping deep into the presumed mountain. 

Eira and merric make it the full 6 miles to the door un-noticed. They are able to take 3 rounds and again un-avoided open the door and sneak in. They decide to go for broke and find the piece of the anticitherion that they need. 

Eira makes it very skillful sneak check agains the walls this inner cave and avoids many guards. Eira and merric both see a big central library (labeled forbiden library). merric sees some books and notices lables as such:
The abomination of desolation
when madness rained from the sky
the day thylea wept

paper slips:
gigan empire records
citizens
population
gigan empire rulers (historical)
the rightnsldls of death
light from darkness
(propaganda potentially)
Very well organized as much so as in mytros and estoria

They are able to sneak into the door to the inner sanctem. 2 scribes are inside. One notices a noise and insists that the other go get the guards. He comes back with 2 guards who look around the room. They come within inches of touching merric but doesnt notice them. Eira and merric, not finding the piece of the antikitherion in this room they only find items on the central tale. center table has  a bunch of glass vials with a variety of potions. We see potions of clarvoince, potion of mind reading, a maroon potion of superior heling, a purple potion labled longevity, gold potion of heroism 

They decided to leave with the guards and regroup on the roof right as the invisibilty is about to end. Merric casts locate object again and finds the charm is in the back left corner. Eira and merric go to the door after merric casts invisibiltiy on himself again. He uses some luck to help eira open the locked door with her steel mirror that just barely opens to her lockpicking abilities. 

They enter the room and are greeted by a , now awake, chandres who has a chest having the piece they need.
