The old man acolyte takes merric to the door twards the cavernous part of the temple. We dash with the old man straight into a mimic who rolled low and we killed instanstantly. We run through the cave and kadeem hears a witches voice from around the bend. She is taunting us. Helios and kallik rush forward to meet a pair of guards of the witch as we begin to fight. eira is the first to go down as the cultist hits her with a wisdom save that she fails.

merric recives a note:

hellaca I require your service. Find my daugher and bring her to me and i will forgive your debt.

the oracle tells us she dosent wanna see or be with her dad

the oracle wakes the old man (protous)

we return

the oracle tells us we must pass a test before we can go on our quest into the 3 seas Her father may not let us win.

we find from kira that she has a part to play in keeping the peace and sacred relics with them. Her father vulcan, sister valis and brother pythor.
