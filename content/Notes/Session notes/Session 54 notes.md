we see the ultros! well hidden below the water and earth.  It is an ancient boat (my guess is 500 years almost exactly)  It has black sails. 

We walk around to the front of the ship. We see that the prow is adorned with a sculpting of a dragon.  We are able to fly ourselves onto the boat (because we fear the depths of the water)  and make it to the deck of the ship. It appears like its brand new as soon as we make our landfall on the deck. 

We start seeing the ghost crew materialize. They are all singing. We start to go to the wheel / quarterdeck . Balthor and helios go first. The captian (who is very wide and substantial) yells to kill em all

We see that they have marks of cydron on it. We do happen to beat them.  We investigate the ships wheel. Balthor identifies that the wheel has "I alone am great" carved into it. 

although not all of us want to we decide to take a short rest. We do. [[Balthor (Chase)]] tries to speak with estor but gets no response. 

We look at the dragon on the front of the boat. It has its eyes cut out. 

We go down to the next level of the ship. We see a set of provisions for a journey at sea. There is also a locked chest. 

There are 24 oars each with 4 ghost men on them. They sit silently and translucently. There is also one non-transparent woman who has a drum (seaming to indicate how to instruct the oarsmen). Her eyes are white and glossy. She may have had blue eyes but they are very faded. She looks at us and asks us if we are ready to sail to mytros.
