captain edma comes about as our navigator. We talk with her. She is excited to be out of the bay. Merric tells her about our deadline. She is concerned but thankful for telling. She doesn't want any of the crew to know though. 

She tells us that the island yonder is one that is "owned" by cydron. It has a bloody history. It is a natural bowl and we will have to scale mountains to get in. It was a stronhold for the gygons.  dragons and their riders had come and turned the walls against them and burnd all the gygons. There was almost no survivors. The ones who did survive wished they didnt. Merric shows edma the anticitherion, as she is the navigator. She seems like she is familiar with it. She says its because its similar to her own compass. 

We talk with [[Kira (npc messenger)]] before we set off. She acts like she is going to join us. Merric loudly reminds her that she agreed to go with her sister and brother to talk to vulcan and tell him that there is 60 days left. Helios also tells her about how merric blurted that figure out to 15 members of the crew and the navigator. She is dissapointed. She is mad because thats supposed to be a secret. and she is more mad that he said that out loud thus invalidating her excuse from leaving. 

we set sail. Edema uses the broken anti-kitherion. she still knows how to use it and plots a course for the island
