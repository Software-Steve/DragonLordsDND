We finish our fight with the giant dog. Kira revives kadem and balthy as they are both being succked into the void by lutheria. The fire salamander is released and she makes good on her promise to light the forge. Helios hits the anvils just to see what its like. This summons vulcan to the forge. He is in general an asshole to everyone. First the fire salamander who is mid rant on dwarvs when vulcan hears and makes her stay to serve the forge for an undeterminate time. He asks how they came back to life. We told him kira. He gets very mad and goes to another room to vent his rage.

We talk to kira and she explains they are not on the best of terms. Merric convinces her to try to talk to him. SHe does but he is NOT receptive and just becomes belittling, beligerent, and a bitch. He calls his own daugher uselless and a waste of space. he does not at present change his mind and continues to be an ass.

we leave vulcan to his own devices. We decide to camp in an offshot down in the forge.

kallik tries to solve his puzzle box. Kadem tries to re-write the corrupted song of creation.

we sleep and have bad dreams with dommy mommy lutheria.
