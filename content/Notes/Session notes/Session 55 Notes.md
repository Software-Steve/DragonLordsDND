We investigate the ship more. We go in some sort of sleeping room we see an adorned box in the corner. We go downstairs and are greeted with magic darkness. Merric tries to dispell it and a section of it does get dispelled for a brief second. For that brief second we see the bones and remains of a variety of creatures. Helios and merric hear a voice that tells them estor hid his dirty deads down here. This implying that this is what happened to the enemys of the dragon lords. 

We walk back upstairs and attempt to get into the box we found. Kalik tries to pick the lock but fails. Kadeem tries to make a key out of clay but balthor and kalik fail to open it and we end up breaking the ceramic key. 

we decide to go to the captains quarters. We see the chest again. Kalik is able to unlock it. merric opens it. Inside we find 75 silver and 25 gold. We find 6 dragon lord coins that grant us access to the necropolis. There is also a small locked iron box.  On this box there is some sort of symbol that has been scratched out. 

the captians quarters are more luxurious then others. The cloth and linnen are made of silk. It smells like fresh wax. Gold fillagree inlayed walpaper line the walls.  there is paper and a jounal on the captains desk.

On the paper reads "i will prove that I am not mad, i alone am great"  Balthor reads the journal. It is estors journal. It looks like the writings of a mad man. However it looks like it is encoded. He finds a passage that dosent seem so encrypted. "while my previous mount has deserted me, i have found something far superior. The ultros is better then any dragon. It has a purpose and life of its own. " Balthor realizes that this passage was done in haste rather then meticulous though such as the other passages. 

We tell the crew that we do want to get going to mitros. We fight against the rushing dark water that is coming in. We take some cold damage. Kadeem makes a cube we can hide from the water in. We do make it out and into the cerulian gulf. It is evening. We are now sailing. We take a look around but after a short while we cant help it to fall asleep. We are now dreaming. We are part of the crew estor arklander begins speaking. He tells us how he will do something tomorrow that will turn him into a god. He will be stronger then kantemane. He tells us it was a pleasure leading us. He tells us he must pick a new captain as he is going to assend to godhood. Only once he chooses a captain will the ship respond to new orders. He calls upon all of us to become the new captain. " i swear upon my lifes blood that I am bound to the ultros " Remove the navagator, first mate, and quartermaster becuse they have failed the ultros. 

We start looking for the crew that failed estor. We see a familiar face of the drummer as we go below deck. One of them is in the thanes (metron) quarteres, the first mate(scathon) is in the captains quarters, the quarter master (davros) fell overboard and drowned. 

as we walk in we see a heavyset man lying on one of the hammocs. the one that was swining in the real world. Helios tries to kick him out of the hammoc. 

We fight him. he does drop a key. We decide to open the chest in the corner. It contains ghosts.
