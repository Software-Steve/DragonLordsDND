A long black furred tiefling that we faught earlier is looking out over the crowd. She looks at me and gives a shit eating grin. This is the one that ira and balthor met in the combat. She is implied to be a follower of lutheria. We all argue more with helios that he wants to enslave us. He keeps saying he dosent. Balthor notices that when hes not looking at helios he dosen't feel the intense feeling against helios wanting to enslave us. Merric focauses hard and thinks that this could be some sort of magical effect. As a result he casts dispel magic on helios. This un-does the magic put on him from a failed trap during the tournament. We all cool down and wait for kyra. Kyra shows up and gives merric the moon charm.
