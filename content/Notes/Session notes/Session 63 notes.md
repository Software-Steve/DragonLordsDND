Balthor starts by asking merric what the note in the locket he found says. Merric, embarassed, simply responds by saying that he couldn't read it and he asked helios to translate it. Helios confused says "it says go to the island of fate, didnt you tell baltor that merric?" Merric does not respond.  Balthor also asks about the locket. He gets merric to identify. Merric finds that it is a locket of protection. First of its kind made by kalliks creator frostdell. It is imbued with enchantments that give it magic nullification properties and protection magic.  

We all question why locate object worked for the wrong object. And why the cult had this object and note. Merric propose that its possible that the chest, the locket, and the note were meant for us but were somehow enchanted and it is our destiny to go to the isle of fates. Kadeem also notices that the locket was made by frostdell as it is the same metal and the same marks as kallik. Kallik is able to read the text on it.  

We seem to agree that going to the island is inevitable and that we are not likely to encournter sydron or lutheria but we should be cautious of the fates. 

The last thing we want to do is investigate some of the items in kalliks bag. As soon as merric picks is up, it reacts to him as a living creature and seeminlgy tries to enter his eyeball. Merric hits it with a magic missile but it dosent die , just bleeds. He uses all his strength and luck to force this cursed object off him. Balthor luckily has a resilient sphere at it to prevent any future attacks. We decide to just put that in kalliks bag for now. 

Balthor also ask merric if he can cast light through him. Merric  is suspicious but gets not indication that there is any of estor in there. Balthor gets some indication that estor approves. Balthor successfully casts light. Merric is facinated. He also picks up on the inner struggle between estor and balthor. He senses  that the magic would have kept going through balthor if he had not been in been in control. 

We notice that the weather and the seas are against us. Adema asks if merric can do anything but he says hes not sure he can. He tries to add some of his luck to the weather. SOMEHOW he is able to overcome sydrons magic and gets the weather patterns to change.
