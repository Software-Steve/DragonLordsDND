And already in. First improvised, thank you, and already in progress celebratory banking. Where nobles important people were whining and dining celebrating the return of the north. Already heavy in drink. Drink and food was had discussions, were had amongst the group and with Annoria and the father of this as well.

Not going quite as Perhaps desired from a certain parties. He's continued being went off to have an impromptu jam session with the band that had been hired for this the rolling stuffs during this bit of, for volatility pipelore attempted to bequeath, a gift to the heroes who had done the steed for him.

His legendary hammer. Under the influence of a purple intoxication. And for going to head in off before, she did something fluid ended up presenting the perfect target for the negative foolishness where pythoris did not distinguish from A stranger or one of his own.

Equipping his hammer to you and probably passing out incurring the Amusement of helios and merit and the anger of the norm. Yep. After that. So he was escorted out based on the commands of the norm, not long afterwards, a Relatively stealthy figure made this way into the bank. We have seeking out an audience with an arm, this being one of the generals The general hip hop.

A goliath general of a story who Determined that now would be the perfect time to strike at the context who have seemingly temporarily lost their Over hood spa. Their football industries. Lost a lot of their lives away over Pythor and less pythor more specifically, the soldiers with them. But being a loyal Individual, that is the sorts.

Some kind of go ahead from the wrong family, determining that type of was both not mistakes, nor even really an individual work. Getting such commandments from he sought out the norm. Gaining some confidence from her brother, helios and aura. Agreed with the gentleman bitting him to take its man to be ridden the call in this.

In return shortly after two the bandwidth where a few more conversations were had. And it was determined that I was a good time for everybody to turn in after a rather long and tense day. Heading to the bed, chambers that had been prepared for each of you. Helios taking one.

The rest of you. Convening into separate one to safety and numbers should recall. Didn't try something after this humiliation? During the night. Then I'd be in on the vental as Kelly stayed watched during Irish watch. However, she heard in the distance. When sounded like the fate sounds of that though.

She as she was not were told of the general and ours plan did not think much of it, decided to leave it for the next day. Perhaps, The rest of the evening being uneventful morning came, All of you will woke Bell for immediately starting. What is becoming one of his morning rituals, getting in.

I knew of the city casting or clear noise. Seeing an interesting site as the Former hideout of the cult seemed to be destroyed laid, flat, many, many roughly from here. Quick glance, 50 or so, cultists laid dead in the street. A number of Astoria soldiers as well as the remaining.

Seemingly on duty guardsmen were dealing with the courtesies rather roughly with the pole tests and a bit more with honor with their own machine. Leaving your rooms you reconvened in the hall Aurora catching up a little bit after and it was discussed that now would be a good time to go to pipeline and get some information as to his promise have for these three tasks that the Oracle bet you accomplished nearing, his bed chambers.

We overheard if not shouting a Aggressive conversation between car and On entering you entered into this conversation. If on the frame, where cars seem to be intriguing Pythor that He made a hurricane or came for his citizens before rulers citiz. And that perhaps it is time for somebody else to take the mantle of command.

As he has file accounts over these long years proven unfit for such attacks. Upon the green to the wisdom. That was given after a game that his daughter should take up, she hitting a bit more confidence from Helios, in his words, agree to take over as leader of the story.

Perhaps, for Pythor to regain some of what he wants. As you were seeking the information, he started to give it to you. That what you knew about the dragons too and where it could be found in the drug and shrine located, not that far, from his actual estate. The fact that the mythical forge relatively relative speaking near the city of a store, I had been lost for some time.

But there was a few sources of potential information that could be gleaned is fed of also, who had taken up both residents and disguised as a poem and should he not have much information for you? Perhaps words that frequent

Frequent and nearby Tavern. Many of whom the older ones of this group planning to abandon members of the methadone Long cast out.

I'm trying to remember that. Yes, and the final bit of information that he had for you the location. Of where you might find the armaments of the dragon bar. That you would need to travel to the necropolis at Tillamook to recover these items. That being at the moment as far as he can, recall The extent of his knowledge of these potential tasks given to you As you were about ready to make your way to start seeking some of these potential hats.

Before you a question, was brought up by car as she had, bequeathed part of the song of creation, these products, You see, kidding me. It was. Offered up that his part of the song of creation had been, in fact, stolen. I live there. That. Is. All right, currently standing before pythor seeming taller than she normally does, but that's clearly more from intense anger rating.

On top of her heliothorpe not actually even looking up still facing now. And there is currently silence as Piper responds. He's doing why?

So, what? How to use for how you break a song.

Song. Had written down. He passed. Should.

Easily. I had. Trusted it to those who might not. I could.

Not wanting another argument, I'm gonna back out. Okay. Now. And, Forgive me if it's that may not be my place to ask, but it sounds important. But what exactly is the song of creation? I may not let that truly means Yeah. Put it in the simplest. The name is Revenant.

Should someone? Play the song of creation. I need some time. Creation is. So you can see that it is something very best take kept. Say.

I see.

Don't remembering Steve's, not here to say. Do we know that he has one of the pieces? He has none of these. He asked about it. Yes. In the matter, you remember, canima asking about the song a while ago and Cara telling him that she, it wasn't her possession of the time.

And that for safekeeping. She divided it into multiple pieces. The, the actual written down song and that she gave it to different places. One of them being pipe worried and that kiddiem is actively seeking or something. Yeah, maybe it was just that he was thinking, I thought he had found.

That way gave him her pieces. Yeah, I might, I might be. Yeah, I'll I can look in the session notes but or the, the trans people. You don't remember that? I don't either. Look I have my number. Yeah because I thought I thought she said she didn't have it.

I mean where that was the whole point because the logical place to look for it would be on her person. Anyway. Yeah, that's what I remember myself, right? Anyway, yeah. Everybody make a perception check. I will make more protein. Just going to overwrite. What? I yesterday that's not my If you.

Want me to just tell you what's my car is or something like, yeah, I'm just trying to make that not happen. Well, yeah, if you only cast the tab that should work, And you opened a new tab and it changes me. Very start. Yeah. Hasn't have Yeah, yeah. Okay perception.

Here we go again. It's been so long since I've done this. Okay perception is plus 30. Okay. Yeah, 1313. Hit the back up. Yeah, 17, 17 being was a natural 20, classic. Of course three, it's starting this conversation. He's good to be. Yeah, third point. 30 point.

Good. He's done. All right. So, I would say that Ira Your 17, 18, 18, 15. Okay, I fell for an talent. You all see as pythor sitting there, Like almost a blur of movement from car's hand, but, like, it seems to just like blur slightly and then be resting still by her side, almost kind of like this kind of motion, but like very blur.

And then it's just back to normal. I will have to tell Steve what he saw is. He's the only one that saw that, you know, but you would also notice that there is a slight cut across pythoris specs, right also. At this point in time, Kadeem is going to just take a step forward.

But,

Yes, this is unfortunate. Nope, that's something close. No better than I would not. Keep it. This truth that I am seeking is this song of the way? Yes. But please, if It is not worth. Removing even more the bond of family between you and yourself. It is not worth creating much, so that between the two of you, Not when there is opportunity to bring.

Together. What has been broken for so long? He's got a check. Allows that one? No, no matter what? That is a 20. It is this person. There's a lot. It's pretty good. Yeah, it's plus five. That is a 23. For a moment. It seems like cause not even listening but you hear

And his twice now. That you have said, words of wisdom. Fall beyond your years of age.

Gonna see. Yeah, I mean he's married so Please take it. Yes but Difficult. And I will thank you again for saying, And being With.

Understanding that the wrath of a God is our God. What? Exactly. Step up.

But I think he's right. And while I really unhappy, And I think, you know why?

Think it just time. The change. Just any rules. I think it's time.

That you get back to who you used to. The man warrior who stood at the front lines. Leading his warriors, by example. Not a would be king. Sitting on the ground. Dream. Reclaim. What you want? For your city, or your people who adopt, From your other. We can't do that.

Just the city but just landed me. The real.

Pause. And he's going to go for a stealth check, because he wants this to be quiet.

Sensory everybody in this room is still rather intently listening to what's happening? I will say everybody go for another perception. Check to see if you hear this next You know.

All right. Figure out what is still based officer decks? Yep. Yeah, all right. Something, I don't know. Five five. Before protein working until Dean. Here, plus three. And we could be actually well again all right, 17 and then everybody. So look at being here like Sitting over there. You know, now nobody Just towering.

Now. And she will with that pythor. Finally, looking up at her car vows in terms around facing you all. Well, now, there we have some leads, I think it's time that we wrestle. Okay. And she started making her way out. I mean I'll mimic up all the pipe or you know some more things respectful and well as you turn to leave, here's a normal runs up and gives you a hug.

Thank you, you as well, strength to the warriors. We won't need it just yet, I'm sure we will need money future, but we like to give a proper good buy some, we still have some business in the cities before we You say my name is as well. I will if I move the van moves, it's like Van Hammond, but with it moves, huh, Mary?

You were standing out in the hall, not very long, and the doors were bad and Cara is walking out with your companions falling.

Convert the square root of. Precious children, he wasn't left alone long enough. This way man, you are out of the room for about a minute. What do you want to do in that memory? Like, oh. I want. Is there anybody nearby? There are a few go. So, presuming, that pythor gave us?

Vague idea of where these things are. I'm gonna inquire about where the dragon's venue is, or do we just implicitly know, but you do you should remember from last time? Helios? Also knows, okay. So, that's right, at least, at least the things in this city. He can navigate us through.

That's all right. But if you want to ask over, I'm just the I'll just get, I'll just try to get some like, info on the place. The background. Yeah, so you welcome guys. Yes. What can I do as wondering if you know anything about the dragons thing? I believe you are referring to the dragon shrine.

Right. That's where we heard it was. Yes, it's not that far. If you leave the compound and immediately, When they look at the map, I'm the map west for the record number seven. Yeah. And by west I mean yeah it's gonna yes, weast. Yeah, that is where it was stationed.

When the shrine was constructed, you should be looking for this item, all you have to do is talk to a stop keeper of the shy. In rather uninteresting man in my opinion, but a good attendant. Who Is quite devoted to the upkeep of the shot. So you should not be difficult to locate.

And anything we should be worried about when we get there. To this ride, right? In what way? I guess miracles kind of play up on the fact that he doesn't he didn't really know what happened last night and And you're like well you know is there is there any cultists or anything we have to worry about on the way there?

You see a big smile cross his face as he goes. I do not think I do meet any two friends and you need to worry about the year next time. After all as we should have done on the beginning, the slaughter. I see, that's Yeah, I'm guessing he wasn't there then.

Not, he was, but he Managed to evade. Plus. Huh, not not not looking forward to meeting him again. Is what the man? And one powerful and then can be killed. Well, it seems that that time wasn't wasn't yesterday though. No matter. Yeah, it seems. It seems that we we shouldn't have any trouble.

That's all them. Thank you very much. Then I'll go at this point. The doors open and you see Cara and the rest of your companion walking out. And they're walking towards you, as you usually go little ways from the door, but not super far.

To the dragon shrine first. It seems like the most logical, I mean, it's the closest, right? Yeah. I mean, all we have to do is drink out of a horn, right? Well, I suppose when we speak with Aesop, we'll find out if that's it. That's well then let's be on with it.

Very labeled. I mean, Unless our patron goddess has a different opinion. If she hasn't stopped, she's not kept walking fair enough. Yeah, well, I don't, yeah. Okay. All right so then make our way there since we're so close to you. All right, well, thank you. I'm walking. So the palace got too much trouble for a brief moment as you peel off.

Caracas seems to stand a little bit. And then follows after you've already started off towards the strong ends, it doesn't take much proper to catch a whole, of course. Yeah. So This shrine sits at the end of the quiet street that runs along the wall with the gore. It's a long, a large stone building with a copper dome, The pediment above the door bears, a marble engraving of the legendary dragon.

All mitra Inside the building, there is a strong smell of incense. You can hear the mothering of prayers as the priests of the shrine carry out their daily.

But it is also making sure there's nothing more. It is still morning, I presume. Yeah. Yeah. It's still, it's not earlier anymore as in a little bit, but it's probably say about 8:30. All right. I guess I'll just approach one of the attendants that looks kind of the least occupied and what they're doing?

Good Morrow, we wish to speak with ASAP, if he's here. Yes, many, many things please. And relatively originally playing looking acolyte runs off a few moments later, you see. And Elven figure male dark black hair wear wearing. Bronze wearing that shit. Yeah, bronze colored robes. Yeah, something another Yeah, walks up.

Oh well. No effects. All right here. I am the keeper this. You requesting my presence. Yes, I as you may know, I am Helios of the story. The rest of my friends can introduce myself. Helios, son of Idaho, It is another way to put it. Americas. America address. How do you do?

I do quite well this morning. I'm not from around here. I am not surprised. Once again, those travel staff. About, and And sure. And he goes into a sweeping bell as well.

My name is from mythos.

Colic. And

I don't think they cannot. What is it that hands the keeper of the shine can do for you? Is fine. That could be Well, as For claim to buy the Oracle's prophecy. We are heroes of the Oracle and evidently a task that we need to undertake to prove that we are leading heroes of the world is to drink from the dragon horn.

I think that that is the patching. I have some left. On has been appropri. If you, of course,

Who's keeping track anyway? Possibly three. Because we don't know where the forage is either. So, you know, she's further into the shrine into a back area where he opened, what's the door of the back doors, going this location that. You see the row. Query is a small stone chapel with three.

Alcohols protected by glass. The glass of the central alcove has been shattered and dark. Purple stains are splattered all over the floor. Surround There was no noise, but this happened inside time either early this morning or late last night. Almost discovered by something yet. It was catching a bit earlier than I said.

But they brought them to my attention. Not long before you walk into. Let's see. Do you have any suspicion as to who may have stolen? Such an artifact I can't say yet as I have just begun to inspect. If you would like to please, The more eyes. More likely.

Details that are using, Of course. Only the way. Can't do that. I said lead to way here. So well then let me understand. So this is like a square room and it has a bunch of artifacts in it. So this is a relatively small stone chapel and there are three like cutouts three alcohols inside this.

Okay? Relatively it's not super large. It's you know if you had to guess it might be like a 20 by 20 foot room, okay. And there's like three cutouts in front of each of those cutouts. They're glassed. Almost kind of like a better trim like a display case and the center outcome the glass has been shot.

Okay understood and you also see purple stands splattering the floor. That's that's all you get from your initial entry. Different. And my assuming it's going to be investigation, checks. Yeah, I don't know how I would like to investigate or I will assist merit. Yeah, I will, I will investigate primarily what?

I'm interested in is a purple stuff, okay? Because I'm assuming it's the same, the same purple stuff. That's they talk about in the sunny view commercials. Yeah, you know what? Because they're always like, we got OJ. So purple, stuff. Sony D, nevermind. All right. Yeah, I want to look at the purple stuff and I want to see if I get any inkling that.

It's a magical. Investigation check and based off of that, we'll have you roll on our contract. Also start with the investigation 21. You do have advantage. Not that it not that it's going to be yeah, 41. I don't think I can do better. No, it's probably enough but I was helping.

You define a play about play? Yeah. It's it's like in those detective movies where like the detective sees the whole thing happening but the 41, you see the whole thing? I mean yeah. 41's a pathfinder number. Let's be real. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's your lock homes. Who already somewhere close with like, Boston stuff.

But I don't, yeah. I mean, it looks like a level 20 character, very high level character. You can probably get better close. Yeah. It's your lock homes. Who already walked into the room and saw the case? Yeah. Well, here's the thing. His investigation check isn't even wrong. He's investigation.

Check is a passive one. Yeah, it's yeah. Maybe a 21. So, looking around. You see a number of things? You see small hook prints among the stains. The sames are very clearly wine and they form a haphazard trail that leads around like around the room a bit and then also the leads Excuse me out of the room in the adjourning hallway because you have been left the room.

You don't see how far it goes. Oh, you at least currently have a bead on like the beginning of this tray and at the and you can surmise that it goes for at least some time, but you don't know where it might start to. Yeah. You do know with 21, I'll say you do know that none of this is magical or at least none of the none of the splattering, nor any of the footprints, having kind of traces in that year, got it.

I you figure that as you've been kind of tasting the room, you figure that the things behind the other pieces of glass might be. Yeah, as I, yeah, expect your focus is, I would also say that you do notice Excuse me. Hold on, let me double check something. Okay.

Actually, let me back up a little bit of that. With a 21. Making the best make in our contract, okay? Sorry. That I can't damn let chief. Yeah. Yeah, that's still pretty good. Yeah, you're free. 14, I think 15 8 plus Six. But then, yeah, 14 14, 14. You're not sure, but the line.

It's off color enough. That's there. Might, it might not be normal. I will. I yeah, I'll just go ahead and count as a ritual cast identify on it, just in case and hey, we might want to follow this trail. I don't know what this is. Sorry. Oh sorry with your 21 investigation.

Check you. Do notice that the shattering of the glass based on, it's positioning and like the patterns was clearly. Someone standing in front of it, going in it into. Yeah, yeah. Not coming at back out the dragon, or just decided to leave like Dating. Don't think so. Okay, cool.

We might want to follow this trail this before our I'm saying it while I'm doing it. We should probably find me this sits down furlough. Yeah, I have the, yeah, I have to sit on that. Do anything, but you don't have to, I'm gonna see if it's magical at all.

It seems a little off to me. Yeah, I also like that as a pop is still working. Yes he's also inspecting the. You see that when you you all start to kind of inspect the floors in the glass itself now that he has the time and kind of sees you can tell that well he sees that there's a missing item.

He immediately goes to the other two lane pains of glass and starts inspecting that first to make sure that nothing else has happened. Besides the theft with the whole Yeah. So I want to check those first and then yeah, it really was doing that while you were inspect. Okay.

He finishes. Well, okay. Yeah. I'm not employed and You share what it does. While it's someone you want. It is this matter? I don't know if that's so in the matter. No, okay, okay, okay.

First off the Excuse me. By anyone. Combined person. Go on of track is the horn. The vegetables. It is. Something that all people of the store care. As an away to remember that mighty needs of that and regarding more Well, itself, as far as I am aware. Has no.

Attributes of itself. As it was. Taken as in memento from the diet for What reason included? Someone have steal it. I could think.

Depending on if this is a thief who wants to gain of variety, It is a well-known value treasure.

To those up in the arcane persuasion. I here to think what might use it for is that they're all We?

Could make it soon for dessert.

Ingredient of some. Hmm, interesting indeed. I mean does I mean if well what typically happens when somebody drinks from it is it just simpleismers is anything actually change.

He 500. Aspect under my,

Interest is. Attempted to be put into play by Python Some years ago. And, But I recommend about 493 years ago. Of cheese and also a relatively small amount. People of our.

Yeah, rather long time because

But he, as far as I understood did it for ceremony of to Is a shine of as a way of respecting. It's great. So soldiers that proved themselves, the value of effort and competitors, that distinguished themselves for skill. Certainly need to make rules. Dealing that doing such a thing for something.

So

Believe. Number of, But also, it's such a frivolous use of

Understood. Point. All right, Kelly, give me a survival. Check to see how well you can follow. Also crying. Look at the whole prints. You point out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Would I know or have an idea? I mean, there's wine and just so much a If you say, make a Of you make some real good.

17\. Seven, seven. All it's kind of hard to say, you know, I was pretty easily and you would have assumed this that these are most likely not hoof prints of forces or most centers, you know, farm like animals. They don't seem to be lifts of, Normal animals and comparing it to your own.

It's pretty easy to tell that they are too small to be your average minotaur of as well, right? But you're not really sure what that might. Before we go on call it, you immediately start the solid out. And you can see that the trail leads out of the room down a hall and out through what appears to be a side and entrance of this fish line and continues.

Let me just check my positions for the map.

That's the wrong map, but what kind of feedings all depends on the demon? In some of them would be homes? Is it possible? Why is it state setters and teeth like small footprints, or small hoof prints? Could also be various kinds of those demons themes, but with one with minus, probably a says, we just not like a cool company.

If ever in facters exist and starts to Need into the city. What kind of If? Ha extension. You get to pretty much like one of the exits calendar and you can watch that it starts to be this direction into the city. I don't know how far you intend to fall now that it's leading out of the bill.

Yeah, how Oh, I'm gonna keep following it to, you know, at least this point. Yeah, you, you may as well keep following because helios at least was gonna be very quick to get out of that room. So we should be able to catch up with you pretty quick ourselves looking, okay.

Okay, then I'll say for the time being call, it gets about here. Your conversation has ended with a saw. You will all witness that collect starts to walk out, and has now been gone through about a minute. What did it? Well, I think it would be in our best interest to follow this trailer as hastily as possible.

If it was in fact, stolen recently, then Perhaps we can catch. Whoever stole it. Yes, without them being able to. Yeah. Get to a good place to hide. I agree. I don't think identifies were Doing right now. Over kind of that job. Met a question. If you carry me.

Well, you have to be touching the spots. So I'm pretty sure it's not gonna count if I'm like if I'm caring you on the ground and you're like, I don't think it quite works there. What it? Yeah. What if I put in my ones again? What water? It's not that it's things.

No, it's stands. Well, I can stay with marriage and I'm pretty fast. We were probably you. Up. Think it's worth you. And yeah, I'd like to know we're going into. Okay, go ahead. So as Helios about for you start the head out, following the direction that you saw in cat going there.

I assume he's pretty easy to fall. He's pretty much because he's not, he's not like running or he's like, because head down like following him very tends to be possible sensors engaged, he has to be busy tracking and we see a big metal man. As opportunity leave to do here.

Okay, so If you would return this, In this, because Of course, return the slides So and you know she has up to college just yet but since Merrick's casting for 10 minutes, it doesn't take you long for you to catch up metallic. Who is it's to about their? Shall we say a little further back talent because you're not hurrying

So yeah, for the sake of it, we'll say fast forward, 10 minutes merit you determine It is wine. Yep. There is a magical essence. And to it.

Can I tell what it is? They've probably wouldn't even fall horn for that. Yeah, hmm. Well, safe, just safe to say it was dumped out of the horn. Alright, something don't happen. That was Okay, as soon as you do, yeah, yeah. Onward. All the children. All right. And I'm gonna As you leave the rooms as you bolt out of the room, I write, you do, see a sub.

Just kind of, I'm just so much. Yep. We're going like a movement. Speed, 45, 45. Okay, since you're hurrying. That's You catch up to? They get to about there and you easily catch up to them. Excuse me, Calic is still following kind of like head down following, even more intently than you were before.

As you're starting to get more to more busy parts of the city, but you still have a lead on the trail

So sorry, Move Citizen care.

Off. I will keep following the trail. Like to be put down. Yeah, I mean not like put down

Like poop. There you go. That I helped him keep an eye on the trail, by trying to get people to move out of the way ahead of him. Yes. And I will allow you to do that because once you get To about here. I need you, I need some, I need Cadillac to make another survival check.

You know, you're at basically the main throw fare this week, right? I would be helping calick out with that. Yeah, well, he's getting advantage from hoping even if you get the fuck out of here. 13, 13. You That's my page. It must be calculating calculus right? Turn right now.

Get jostle a little bit calic by an individual running past you rather hardly he bumps into you and you lose side of the trail.

Trying to take another guy. Yeah, yeah. I'll try to help him. Pick it up again investigation. Check. Not investigation. Make it survive. Okay. Specifically for Taylor.

19\. With this time like resentering yourself refocusing on like the path, you just follow and this time both Ira and Balthour kind of getting more the attention of the crowd and starting to shoot them away, kind of giving you like a nice circle around you calick on, you focus in and you once again actually do manage to find the trail So the trail leading this direction, the foot words of this, south part of this, you can be beautiful there, but I will say Real quick like oh, sorry we're all good.

No anyway there. Girl, yeah, yeah. For one there, when you get to about there, Yeah, I've got a proper way rather familiar shop to a few. Calex. So, The door opened. And You actually everybody recognize is a rather tall figure. Oh, the first time. No. Well this is not the most.

That's who we still do we see walking out of this? Yeah, you see walking out a rather tall figure bald. Head gray scan. What seemed to almost be like darker gray, almost tattoos for lack of a better term kind of adorning. Like some of the muscles muscular arms that you see a bit of face.

Very noticeably bandaged head. Missing. What looks to be? Is a tire forearm. He recognized general, you know, him as a general, kidnock specs out of the store. General. Videos. Compatible with some videos. I'm paying my mind. I'm not, I don't know anything about the stores so it's time not suspicious to me.

That's fine, out of character. Highly fucking suspicious. I'm just gonna impress that because there's not like a magical limry roast potion floating around on the shelf continues on. He does go. What? And he's I the war films. It's not. Yeah. Like the bandages, like covering kind of like this.

Yeah. I mean not the one I and the one and they still has kind of tracking past you all as he follows Kalik a bit. The Man, or what he is doing. Yes. Called that up man. I know not what else to call him. I said, I suppose these may not necessarily be a hidden but he is Yes, he is a sentient.

Magical construct is about the extent of my knowledge. Immediately looks behind him into the Looks back at you. Know that people will. Making such.

Nori. It's not in subject in which I have much knowledge. But, He says what he's doing is clearly following the trail. Yes, evidently the dragon horn was stolen from the shrine. We are And in hopes of retreating it is quickly as possible. Security. What? Today. Maybe find it quickly.

My thanks, Jim. Okay explaining yeah yeah, yeah. Catch back up on him. Yeah. Not hard. You catch up? Yeah. He's like 13 feet away. Yeah. Just so you continue on. Yep. All right, you make it Let me scroll down making our way down town. Walking, not fast, slow not particularly fast.

Yeah, but yourself back at six or, you know, on that down streets. Oh. You doing on and you can clearly see as it's a little a little less crowded here. Currently this trail, very much looks like it is leading out of the south exit right there. Well, suppose we can try to make our way a little bit more quickly.

Now, since it does seem pretty obvious at this point that it's going out of the city, you know, try to keep an eye and make sure we don't like past the end of it. But okay, you guys saw anyone special? I'll keep track actually. Yeah that's a good idea actually we'll go ahead and at least table useful quickly kind of jog do they want to speak with the girls you rush up to?

The guard soundtrack. Because it just, ah, once again, you see the rather well-worn armor. Those slight gray beard that folks out from underneath the helmet of the veteran that you've seen on a number of points. Good morning. Well, give them my quick solute. Did you happen to notice anyone passed by with a horn or hooves?

Trying to hide something. Perhaps, He immediately points to an oncoming caravan of what looks to be. Maybe two to three minotaur, farmers courting. Okay once again it's a relatively poor looking bison. Like from outside the city coming towards the city. Probably not, they would have been in the city trying to reach The best guesses within the past few hours, we are not serving.

I guess that this point I'll just kind of what were my voice so that surrounding people can't. Over here hopefully very much. But I will explain that, like, I did to the general that evidently to try again. Horn was stolen from the shrine. We are in search of yes.

That's what the general said as well. We ran into him on our way. App, that doesn't say that. Brothers, tend to

I know what you're thinking. And yes, I am. The perfect one. Even literal brothers. Yeah hilly as well. I actually chuckled a little bit at bad. Of course. And saw anything. Pretty occupied or really a small. Fair enough, I don't not sure if it was taken. Using the fight.

As a distraction, we don't have an exact time table. Surprised. What was intentional or not? You know. Thank you, We will be on our way. Fortunes. I pray that you find it many things.

If you have across guys again, Yeah.

Yeah, Hitler's doesn't live at that, that's mad but Yes, boy. Dr.

One next we made a shell. That's all. It's so interesting. It's about at this point in time you do, catch up still following the trail software. You know, so I guess we'll follow our bloodhound bloodhound but what Getting what the people coming in. Yeah, yeah. You follow the trail.

Like is often a side of the road like once you get to about here, it says being like on the edge of where the the farmer seemed to be kind of on the main Way, so they're not obscuring the path or if they're not obscuring, the trick I should say.

Do the mentors looking at different and she doesn't know they look a little different than you. Oh, they seem a little larger, but these ones in particular, seem to be a little fair, they look a little He now nourished not to the point of severe unhealth but it's going in that direction, some of them, some of the first seems to be a little matted and on the camp now.

No, they got the mange. All that mind. Yeah, just following Catholic I guess as soon as he starts a decent view of the trail we're following, Actually what? Well, never mind because we've probably not gonna catch up that quick.

Cold little bit. Don't know. I might be done. I have no idea. Oh no, I'll say that. So you'll feel the icy hand of death, even a man. Or that or when that says my safe, not that day, does that mean, I know I'm dying. Yeah, and would have been real bad if you put your hand on him though and you went wild, make your call.

Yeah but that's that's when we know next time when that's cool. Here's the thing holding here, okay make that statement but nobody's gonna believe fair anyway. So In making your way southward. And you have now very clearly left a store behind, you know, So, mmm, how long do you continue to follow the train?

To its end, I mean, IQ go and I assume we do have to go and to find it. About. Say about seven hours of travel later, the news right away. Just falling down over the line. Well, actually, let me rephrase that have any of the look at the map.

And I need to use some calculations. Never. Okay, like show. Just don't bank account.

Hmm.

On average. How far can people walk in? Three miles an hour. Yeah, generally speaking three hours, okay? So let me refraze that because the map looks very much larger, the distance given is not that much. So yeah, let me backtrack a little bit so you travel on for about

Yeah, for your first hour heading southward and you start to hit a very dense wooded area. Okay, at about this point car, Reappearing, mentions. If we continue going south, it won't be long before we make our way into the old woods. Number of things within. Those are words, but it appears that something from there.

Decided to come and steal this. Well, one way or the other. We've got to get it back real quick. Medical question. Do we know if Saters exists you and you, I could eat And call it would know that they do. So I would say merit does not is better long now.

I am probably dozen because she hasn't been here super long either and has been whether one location. Yeah, but just from from your traveling in history, the dean's history and traveling. You three would know that if say, those two And do frequent areas have a heavily awarded, I'm assuming what we'll find at the end is probably a sader or number of them or what have stolen the horn.

Would be super.

Yeah. So let me do this. I need to switch to a different map. The this map for the country.

Thelia. So yeah, you're kind of nearing this area at the moment.

Huh, I knew that. I knew that I don't know. You continue. Moving on. Yep. Before long you do indeed, find yourselves in the woods. Mmm, make another survival check. To continue to follow the trail through the woods.

Seven. Who

What was that? Sorry. Seven. Seven once you get into the woods it doesn't take you long. Even though you've been trying very hard to follow. It just having to divert around these before long cowlick, you lose side of the track. You are about two hours into the woods, like from from the moment you met the edge, you've been walking for about two hours.

So I'm telling you've been walking about five hours. Do we see any? Obvious sign of a civilization or people of any sort like fire like campfires that kind of thing. Not currently, you see very heavy, forests tree coverage even though it's still light out, the trees are not yet dense enough to block out the sun.

But it is noticeably darker down here than it would be in the opening. Yeah, this time of day. Not enough to really be a problem but it is. I've signed and just how thick the covenant is. In contrast, a site. I actually want to try to listen to see if I can hear the sounds of it.

Typically be associated with sayatives like party and revelry, that sort of thing. Okay. I know. Yeah, I have no idea where in the woods. They might be able. Yeah. Just keep trying to keep an ear open for that. Hey.

That is a method that's 22. Interestingly enough, you strain your ears listening in tech, very stop stretching. It's only like the briefest. Chain in the natural sound unifor. Know what almost sounds like a slight. Flutter on a flute. Okay slight giggle, the southwards. So yeah. If I if I had that direction I'm gonna Start heading all that way.

So heading off that way, make it survival check. 17 as you continue on. And as you watch helios walk off, he doesn't get very far before you look around and you look down almost kind of trying to get over a big tree room. It's more so than anything, but you get on the other side helios and you find the tray that's small, okay?

Yeah, and we've heard versions you continue on for another

You continue on for another five hours, it's starting to get done. Wood. You have traveled about 10 months. No, I said that really smiles. Yeah, three miles from an hour, I had enough. So yeah, that would be about two hours you travel, another two apples, a little bit having to do with just the nature of the rollers, and this year, volume of the tree.

But eventually you find yourself. To what looks to be a slight clear. You see before just grows dark around you with barely any light making its way through the campaign. You hear birds and beasts clamoring behind you in every bush. But eventually the path, you're following seems to disappear into the underbrush.

You you emerge into a dimly lit clearing. So rounded on all sides by oak trees. The forest suddenly grows quiet, you can hear something crashing through the bushes ahead of you. And feel the record this way. So pack. I have no idea. Whoa, I tried my best. Yes, this is the right page.

Thing. Yeah, there it is. Oh, ignore that. There it is. Yeah. Yes. Probably which. Yeah you from going right? Open the corner. Yeah. So if you want to put your pedals, yep. He's And differ. Any welcome? How many hours we were going? Like they never had for so right.

Oh, five plus two. Yeah, seven. Yeah, I had my hours. Oh good. Oh good. So yeah. You start to come into this clear world and you see A young girl bursting into the clearing. Over. It's a child. Kill it. Yeah, I'm trying to get there but I'm looking at them.

I'll just look at my computer. It's easier. They want. Yeah. Yeah, verse You. Are you really there? Please help. And then you hear? Our crashing through. I can't do cool sounds, but who sounds? And a couple coconuts and together. One of the. See, six dope headed. Individuals averse out right behind her.

She is running towards you. These six individuals running after her, Child, she will be a sweet dinner. All right. Well, I don't like the sound of that. So I'm gonna get a person go. Yeah. Point. Do you have those trends down? Yeah, yeah. Is with you. Yeah, take it.

Hey, hey Shithead! Give me the horn involvement. Hi To me what I want. And we're not eating, go for dinner. All right. I should get some more. Six, I'm getting hungry. Yeah. It's okay. And, Yeah, all right.

All right, it's all over here. Okay, probably back. Maybe. These always the rear. I just hear the ocean probably being in front. Yeah, was nothing away. That is true, right? What other was Here, we use the left one, left, pink one. Even yeah. Well yeah, since I was kind of spearheading the charge at this point we probably should be in our own squares of this point.

I assume these are five foot squares. I will actually So yeah. So yeah, what is now we have an interesting quality but it's being kind of a little diagonal, where we? It's not. You want the DMV? It's probably in. It's part of it's probably something from here in the It's Yeah, if it's not in the yeah it's not even beyond, it's in there or the maybe It's using their appendixes.

Yeah. If it's from a DMV public, if it's from a wizard published book, it would be in DM. Think that's where they put them in most of the features because you wouldn't put them in the book. You know, I just gotta find it. For those people. Slipping through your shit.

Yeah, when you flip to a page that says Colossus abroads, I know what that is. Mmm. I never got that wondering sit by. Sound like the island of roads or Rhode Island. Yes.

I don't know what I'm old island is but hot. Tell you what? It would probably know what road island is. He probably hated problem. Maybe we'll find out in the new season. Then let's be interesting to see what they do with it. Monkey gallons.

Hey, I'll grab all That I'm red corn. You fucked my wife. Now you're gonna die. Well, I don't know all the way at the back. Okay.

He was like, Really. Okay, I'll just have to be this with paper Any paper or you got it. And he has some more chicken. That's some more pi. It doesn't matter if it's boiled to fried just. Okay. So we've got That's a good wailing and national teeth intelligence. We've got purple.

We've got. Don't. Remember light green, right? Shut up. This, we put the D4 back near to the, to the D20s because she hasn't made it all the way towards you. Yes. To 24. I think we've kind of green. Damn, it's that close little girl might be dead meat here in a second.

I don't know where the house is supposed to be about that. She's she's not super far away from them. Things happening. They were definitely gaining but have not caught up. Okay. She just, Small tiny is very specific again. Yeah, you're right. Like see, yeah, pinky. I mean, you're gonna be bigger than a pixie, instead, we tiny but yeah, pixies are good example, that mean interesting character.

Well, the player character fairy can't be tiny. They can be small, okay? Because tiny would be yeah, really hard like hey, hey the this window that's opened by an edge. Yeah, my character doesn't give it 16 years. Yeah, 16 as well. Michael 16. Lara 14. 14 years also for Again, 16 All righty, that's 16s.

And then single this. All right, has a 14. Okay, and so starting with The purple one. What is he gonna do be purple. They see him purple, they purple. You added personal. Going. Talk here. So let's show the phone. It's gonna start.

Blue. It's gonna start with its marker. And who's what's the order like is everybody position helios Ira and calico up front door? Our second in the back. Oh, it's up front. Okay, the purple one is going to you watch as one of the ones near the back. This new year, goathead black bird, goat head, long horns, kind of a sickly Old gray skin color to go black black.

He kind of swells slightly and then you hear him? Shout at Damn, go fuckers. He shouts that at you. Your face. Inspires me to vomit. I need you to make a wisdom, saving you. Dirty, 20, 30, 20. With a weird. Magical intrusion that normally such a Poor heavy. On intelligent insult with mean, very little to you, for a brief moment.

You feel I'm gonna beat your goddamn message. Son of a bitch. You drip your spare, your shield. You start to see red. Like you shake your head like and you resist the effect. Wait a minute, I'm much better looking than that. Yeah, my sister told me so. This week.

Oh see he's gonna move his oh wait, I needed to check. If these are false squares, pretty sure I would assume because we're about, we're about 35 feet away, five feet, Finish open for well, I guess it depends on what you do all day. Yeah, it's the alternating five.

15 to 20 30. So yeah. 30 to, right there, he's gonna rush off. It's alternating forward. I did that right. The child who's running, right? Fine is one 30 30 about 35. That's what I said. Wow, that's unbelievable. So you watch us this, this goat headed monsterosity and just yelled at helios runs up to the small child.

Go about opening why with really square looking and fights down after. And she manages to slip in what looks to be like some of the white glass and just get out of rain for the butt. In which case he's going to have these closer. He's going to take a second action to swing his sling and he's going to throw it at.

About 35. Well from him. Oh yeah, 50, yeah. Yeah, why don't throwing the slang at you? That is a 15. Mm. So you see like actually kind of gets back up you kind of promise pulls out this small swing lips around roses and you just like seeing it coming, you just raise your shield.

All right. That was his turn. Okay, now, go on to it is the brown ones. Turn around. He's also going to move bathed and brown. But don't don't beg men. Oh 15. Here he is going to shout. You watch him also swell from a moment and then shout twist and yo mama no please please.

And then as he left as a large enough with his words, I've seen more attractive cows than you. Saying that at, I Wisdom wisdom. 13 13. Once again, I ride you for a brief moment, you feel horribly insulted by these words. You almost take a step forward but you immediately shrug off these petty petulant and honestly just stupid words.

Yeah doing that he is going to take his sling. And shoot it at. Yeah, the person he insulted. All right. It is a what I do. What she was a sling. What? Okay. So it is a, don't hit the little girl. Yes. It's a range left and tech. Yep.

Depends on the move 16 to hit. I want to use reaction. Okay, to deflect for If you're hit it would hit me. This is 60. You. So the damage take it from a tech is reduced by 210 plus 8. So, I guess you would have to roll the thing image.

Yeah. You you would but I mean, unless they're shits out of the out of this world, I don't think they can roll above an eight with a sling. So, yeah, you wouldn't take me leave. Even have to worry for it. So yeah heard sick you're gonna do something. Yeah.

It's a I mean what was it five. Yeah I have a plus eight together so this this small projectile flies out and, you know, definitely just catch it in the air. You hold it up in front of you. It looks like a small rock. I'm not gonna put them back so that's more than 20.

Yeah. Seeing that he immediately, you see him, reach, kind of like in a small little pouch by his side seemingly, reloading the sling and he throws a second. That is a 15. It meets so beads. Yeah, maybe something Beach this time hit And you would take. Four points of election and damage.

Okay, and I need you to make a constitution say No, they're fleeing shit covered rocks that. 14, 14, as this small, metallic sphere slams into your shoulder, as you look at it, it doesn't do all that much damage it sting, but the thing that catches your attention is the fact that it's slightly and as it falls down, you feel this intrusive poison.

But get into your veins for you, grunt your teeth and you manage to structural fucking animals. So, you just fling, your shit. Next is the green one on yours. Place, I don't it was just Team 20. 2530, he's gonna get behind this, he's gonna get behind shit. Yeah, yeah.

He's respectable enough to be behind cover one. He's actually like, yeah, three loading himself so he loading Against behind the cover. And once again, he bellows out. So my mother was a hole mark. I just charged this up not listening on some field to be some pricks, unwanted new tensile.

Oh yeah. Fairly clever insult for an intelligent, be or presumably unintelligent. I have no idea how smart these things are not the brightest but they're not stupid enough. They're about average, they're smarter than some of the people in this group. But oh, okay, 13 years once again, funnily enough for you of you don't totally understand who he's trying to say that difficulty.

You kind of look around at your campaign just words crush over you, and you just don't really get it. I mean who's he talking to like you're still defender? You're still defenders. Perfectly helpful. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense just out of it. Okay, we're seeing that. He's going to take his two sling attacks.

That is a 22 to hit. You have a very okay. Yeah, me, yeah. So that makes a political budget. No, sorry damage. And I need to make You saying, If you Room. Yeah, maybe on the defenses. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, they simply separately, said boy them. Yes, this point But this is poison.com maybe and how many of them know 25.

25, probably, once again, this small metal ball, hits your shoulder and you see the the Poisonous remains on your side and you just kind of Wipe it off The second slang. I was built as a garbage but the second is only as well The second ball. You see flying out and you just kind of hold up your spear in front of it.

Things on, Okay? Okay, so that was pretty, dark green. Okay, so now, okay, Helio, what's your decks? My decks is plus two, okay, America's your next plus three plus three. Okay, so you go then one of the goatman will go because you both roll 16 We'll see about that.

That that will see, depending on what you do and what you attack. Well, there's enough of them. There's enough of them back there. I'll just go. I'll just go ahead and move up a bit and I'm assuming the child should be in like one of these other squares and not in the middle of one if there are five.

You know, he almost better he was on fire but yeah, these are five. Yeah, they're fun. So You know, I mean, either either way, but my point is she shouldn't be in the middle. Of course she was on the very corner, she wasn't. Yeah. But two people can't occupy this.

That is true of. Okay. Yeah, I keep thinking that they're ten. Right. Yeah. So just put her to the center of the that square, because even though like, yeah, brains. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. They are adjacent. So they could hit her. So, yeah. You can hit, The back five without hitting the child.

Yes I can. That's all making sure that is exactly what I'm gonna do fire. Well, yeah, I know how marriage things. Well, we get it. Well, I did prepare flaming spirit, just in case but, you know, they're just all back there. So flammable you be surprised, how fast. Okay.

All right. That's pretty fucking good. Sixth 12, 18, 20 28, 30 36, 35, 36 18, 28 30. Yeah, it should be 30. 35, I mean that's it. Good. Okay. So how much damage well depending on whether they pass but they're not too. Yeah, I'm not gonna roll. The five days, America just big dick.

Eric, you kind of not on my watch asshole. You have a hustle forward all the way back. It marks around. You actually watches a couple of the headed features like follow its art, as it looks kind of like in the center of all five of them. There's this love.

You know and immediately like just bits and pieces of these creatures flying, all directions as they all like incinerate ash, but let it hit the ground. Okay, okay. Runs up and jumps does a 360 thermostat. So that's the dark green on the map. Objectives X out of all of the ones.

And I assume the other goat man. Doesn't get bigger as it probably heal you. This is it. No the one that was the other one that over 16 does not go. So it is either well, go Helios. No. Watch. I'm not gonna be able to hit either attack. Didn't want you talking about.

Standard. Yeah, it's about what I figured. Oh, the higher of the two is an 11. Both don't hit you. So you rush around brush your speakers out and your spirit strikes out this goat man in a literal white face, panic, attack. Watch as his black shirt is like he has now started fighting for his lucky.

Just immediately like listen to a panic role on the ground and imagine his post, right? Some of them sir. Okay. You do it, Chase. You do a chase be today? Yeah, you do. Oh obviously, you have to come up with a witty remark for vicious. Mockery, I believe in you Chase, you're the closest to a seat.

That's why I like you. So he's on the ground now, right? Well, he's just kind of not that he was dodging. Okay. Okay. Effectively, not only Dodge, no, well, I assume he wouldn't be behind total cover or else. He couldn't have made his range. Yeah, yeah. Spells don't care.

Well yeah, typically only for a total cover. Yeah. Yeah since it's a save it doesn't matter. I'll do this. Just so I'm not even trying to accent. How could you do the fireball so far? It's such a younger picture. The guy you have no idea? You just or was that the question?

Well, that was a question. Do I see bits like from the fireball thing? Maybe there's a lot of ash flying around. Right? It was pretty big exposure. There's a lot of bodies that now added, so maybe you go. Oh no, you might be next to blow up. Okay, that is a Jew, might be the next two blower wisdom, say you might just be, oh boy, that's so blood.

That is. Zero. Oh yeah, he's scared. Listen, I'm older too. He has a minus two, we don't use pathfinder rules for ex or else that would incredibly difficult. Well yeah, hey yeah, you watch as peelios, you watch as the goat man, kind of gets up. He's kind of like trying to like do this and seems so long as so rich.

As we just here, get the most yeah, step forward, don't know, he's little instruments, hit the keys look and then shouts out and you watch as the goat man's eyes, just like with red and then like you watching blood just for that is eyes. His ears, his nose, and he just slumps out, he just looking, dude.

Out in the meta. I forgot that yellow is supposed to be level one. Still? Got it, my bad. I completely forgot about that because we, we haven't progressed or so long. I forgot America the one. Well, now knowing that, they, this was an encounter for a level one's. That was complete overkill, which almost makes a better world.

So fucking, I know, I don't know if I could do that again. That was really good, that's what seven above average. Yeah, that is how guys, well 806, I'm pretty sure that that's just statistically. Just in statistics terms significantly above average good, you know, That, you know, Yeah. And of course, as like called it, I missed both of my attacks, okay.

Feels that Rolls two and four really creature, that I would have one shot if I wanted. I'm not good at my job.

For married. If that was good. Yeah, burned them saved, child. The child is like. The child now is shelves. Fairly. I mean, I Just like, Good day. This fucking fireball. What have you done? It could be pretty fun. You're getting chased by a bunch of goat men. That part.

Wouldn't be fun. But then you see the clothes? There's a porthole looking Jeff, like just it's in a nail. Like it's all of them. That might be pretty fun. Yeah, I mean fun but I want to join the Air Force when I grow. PSAX like what's the air force?

I didn't think about this because I was too trying to learn. Write things down, That explains a lot as to why they have five health. Dave, my boy could have hit my attack. I would have actually one shot The two that I wrote a two and a four. Yeah.

About that point, using a highest level spelling. On the class 13, I forgot all about the fact that this is still technically level one. So that's why. Anyway, so you can do it again. So anyway, as you killed the first six, another 20 of you, Went 30. How'd they come, I'll burn them again.

New. Anyway, we're called and even 15 for my kills again. 15th Americans.

Yeah. So you managed to kill all of these go. The girl is still running towards you toward your group.

She looks to be. And slapping it. She looks to be fairly young. Looks to be roughly no older than maybe eight years of age. You can tell dirty some of the clothing that she's wearing has some like cuts and scratches through the clothing. Looks, she's got some superficial like cuts and scrapes.

It doesn't look too worked for where looks very much out of breath. And Trying to hold back with you to imagine is a very close to near panic based on recent event. But you kind of stops just trying to regain progress. Do not rotary, you are safe from the government.

Now,

How did you get out here? Anyways? Here. My name is Karina. I am the daughter of Varicose velor of the video. How did the story? My friend, and I my friends and I would not be playing Near. Here to be here, and This woman, she was beautiful. And she's saying and she dance and I don't really know what happened.

I could We followed her here.

That she was Demetra, she told us, and she told us that this was a place that we could follow can dance and have fun and Don't know where my friends are. Do not worry, we will kiss your friends back. Eric, why are you talking like that? I know, not what you think.

They probably still in the temple and she points over her shoulder to From your position. What you can see is a very large facility. Little boy. The letters make haste. All right, go begin. That's a great intemples. But no, it's just Fireball. Well, my father, the king.

Laying about myself.

At this point, do you all? What do you do? Yeah, I'm headed. All things at the temple, you know, trying to be as alert as possible. For any potential ambush, you safer with us than out? As you start off, we're like the girl kind of hangs back for a moment.

But yeah, and then you hear If it's all the same, I think it would be best if I take this.

And you see Colorado standing next to her homeless and yeah, Oklahoma is my thoughts exactly. Perfect. You could be here in back in the flesh. Think the okay. It's so amazing. Yeah, I was gonna say the, you gotta lay it on a little thicker, hurricane. It's a little, like, Below.

Oh, you don't mean the accent? No. Nothing turns to the child that she does comes around because she turned to you and she starts to walk into the woods and even though it appears though, she's walking she walks and she's like 30 feet ahead and my steps. It's kind of like that the motion of her legs is that of a person walking, but the distance that she keeps getting is impossible for me.

Onward to go. She goes full force. Oh, straight the kids. And you'll imagine based on the speeds that you've seen car move, there's probably a reason, she's not just vanishing in reappearing, but 10 minutes. And go, can you handle the speed of light? Just hmm. And you're here in your head could even hear them has had things the speed of light.

Yeah, I follow heliosis charge. You are going in. All right, which we moving. Yeah, straight down since we could, I guess see it the best that way. Yeah. Okay, so that's not where the horn of the bowtray is I'm going to assume that it'll be a good place to start looking.

Yeah, more goat meat more goat meat. I don't know that I'm gonna eat these. Gaming. I mean, they're kind of discussed and looking they did throw shitty. Yes. Although I suppose I wouldn't know that because I didn't get hit with them. Oh, what's my shield? What?

Large standing, stones twice, this fight of man of a man, the canopy is less than each in the immediate vicinity. Each of these stones is covered in squashes of green, fuzzing moss there arranged in a half circle. As you pass you can clearly feel that like that. They're cold to the touch almost on naturally cold because you don't actually have to physically touch them to feel that just as you pass by, and you can sense that they have been here for a very long time.

As you get close to, that making your way continuing, so a software like this close. Or yeah, once you get to about fair, you hear a very loud. And basically descending from the, the lighter canopy is a small grace worth that lands on one of the stones and is just like, chattering away.

Is that behaviors? Yeah, at you helios the nearest to the stone like, for almost kind of like, Fucked out like a good agitated. Yeah like it's advocated and it's practically like stamping up and down and cavern. It's going to give it an odd log base of those. As I start to move like around the past by as you move it, life follows your gaze and before long

What's your in the class? 18 18, it bounces a small piece of acorn off of your shield.

Think Same way to throw it at you but it just it's an acorn. So, And this world continues to chatter at, What is it that you want? It continues to promote and chatter. Another piece of acorn. Supposed to This one also gets you feel. Probably. If you keep that up, I will throw something much larger at you in return.

Squares still chattering today, you know, I guess I'll try to see if I can identify this statue. I'm going to assume that. That's what it's chattering about because I can't speak squirrels. So You're going to what try to identify this statue. You see if it's like a little figure that I'm from where we are with it's not necessarily a statue, it's just a pillow.

All something my mistake. You said they were twice the height of a human. Yeah. And in my brain I heard human and false statue, they got it.

Okay. Yeah. If it's not even a statue I really no idea what the fuck this girl wants me to do. I guess I'll look back at the group and just shrug Every walk away from it. It's wrong. They're gonna I'll, I'll take a step past and see what it does to be out of the circle actually get farther away from it, like, past a certain amount of feet.

Mm-hmm. In immediately stops looking at you and turns to the groove and starts doing the exact same thing. Okay, well I guess that being the case, I'm just gonna walk like 10 or 15 feet out of it and yes you get far enough away from the snow. A stone immediately focuses on the group who are now closer to the cell.

We got it and it's starts chattering and occasionally thrilling. Oh, you get hit in the head with an acorn marek. Just what I said, I'll tell you, take no damage. It's it's a little Don't expect maybe he's got these buffets over here. He seems like a relatively mangy like a slightly more mangy squirrel.

Then you've seen before. You know, I mean, I'm just gonna wait anyway, clearly has a lot of energy or something. Better than having, I'll walk up to the stone also. Okay, as you get closer to the stone, it freeze. Can you move Iraq? And Me. As you two move closer to it, it seems to focus from kind of the group to you to in as you get close, our chattering away, gnashing its tea.

I read you. Get hit in the eye with me. And you, you take no damage, but you are mildly annoyed.

Oh, okay. Wait. How's your human rights? Yeah, well, and a half so maybe. Come to those. Do you touch the sun? The minute you put your foot on the stone, the squirrel immediately brushes down, crawls onto your legs, starts going around, and it goes into your clothes and starts biting it.

Okay's world. Oh shit. That's a national 20 from squirrel bike, right? You take four points of piercing damage as the squirrel bites you, and it's like you're abdomen, right? It's like now, like crawling around under your clothes and it going to bite again. I'll try to get it. Okay.

Oh, you're a whole lot nicer than I would. Because if you can't do the reverse, it is so it's true. Make an actual just use something. Make a straight deactivity to see if you can catch. It, are you gonna beat it stick sterity since it's trying not to be caught?

So, yeah, I mean, it could just be a grapple chick, which normally is contested, okay? It would be athletics for you and then athletics or acrobatics for those Which I assume it's gonna work accurately. Yeah, athletics versus actual bags for contested graphics check You actually worried? Yeah, I I'm gonna walk around Forgot.

It seems to preoccupied to patented Steve at you. Linux. Yeah and the scroll got a 17 acrobatics so you you met you like reach into grab the squirrel, but it manages to slip out of between your fingers and it is going to attempt to fight you. Technically she could do it a second time.

Since it. It only counts as like, one attack of an attack action. That's okay. She could technically try it? Yeah, that's a 15 this time. So you do this and it's signed by again, that is a 17. Yeah, all it was nice to roll three points appears in damage.

Does this girl just time it actually bikes like in your collarbone? All right? Those the lump of squirrel, under her clothes, count as me, being able to see it, now I'd have total cover from. Yeah, you cannot just imagine this almost Like the idea now and be able to see either try to do it again.

He 13. Now what does today? This time you do manage like it says it bit you like up here. You're like poked its head. And you managed to like, instantly, grab hold of it and you pull it off of you and you pull it out of your clothing and that's squirrel is just, yeah.

She'd like to bite it. Okay, thanks. So for by defense, It's gravel technically. No. I mean I well I guess you can argue that since it's a tiny creature that it would be restrained by the grapple that's up to him. I would say it's a squirrel. It's it's restraining it so it's like gone anyway.

So yeah, that's advantage then. Yeah, it wouldn't be from grappling but it's small enough. It's restrained by the grapple. So, I mean, it's a squirrel with you. That's not gonna be able to get away unless it doesn't damage. Yeah, that's fair. Oh, okay. So, 22 is definitely squirrel you

Three. Okay. You see something real quick like probably does. Whatever. Okay, so you bite into the and immediately upon sinking your teeth into the squirrel. There's kind of a weird vibrating sensation in the squirrel as instead of a squirrel. You're looking into the eyes, the rather glazed over eyes of a of a note.

I still like it's bloody but the thing bite, doesn't it? It's auto. Yeah, so I regain free. Okay, so I mean you're not Okay, so immediately let you go from restraining to grappling. Because now it is a slice of a small group. You see that this is a male.

No, and immediately upon that, what do you what are you doing? What are you doing here? Why are you here? Why are you here? What did you like me? Oh, my That's all. No Josh. What are you doing here? Who told you, you could be here? These are mine.

What are you doing here? Who are you? Right. But I really like best one that hit. Sorry your school you baby immediately bites. You Since he is unknown, he does not Who's like he immediately just starts like biting. It could technically be, an unarmed strike. I won't so long.

He's like actively like somehow biting like, I like the most like, like currently like taught and like hardened muscle. Hey, and he's not even like doing it. Well, you can see that he's like somehow managing the perfectly bite you, where there's heat missing. So he's not really like fighting you the there's like a couple of his front teeth that are very fully missing and like the piece that he's biting like it's going right there and like touching the gum, it's not really doing anything.

All right. What do you wear? I'm my wood. Yes! What are you? You are here. What are you doing here? My woods. Yes, what you? Yes you who you? What do you want my name? Ira window. Who you? Put here. Oh yes. Look you ah, Why you here watching what you want?

We're not here to hurt you. No. We can no no I not strong enough. And I just ready in Elgin. Plus remember here. Borrowed. Not your problem. Yes, God. But I, hey, what you want. UN. He were a school, right? Mmm. Yes. Many animals can be. Yes. My ability.

Not given by other my I do. Yes, unique mission. I just do. Yes. What you want? We're looking for also children. That I take it, we children disgusting. Shame. Shame you shame. You shame bad. You bedroom. Well, no, we were rescuing the children from weird goat people. Evil things.

We killed some of them. Well, especially I'll point to America, where they're like, he incinerated them, America. You haven't not watched past? No, no, he's still behind. Shut right person. You belong here. Not. No, no. You shouldn't be here. I'm just like, I'm pretty sure I'm taller than you.

That's not right. Going back and forth the soap fucking hard, really? No way. Do you protect? I protect important. I'm here for the sun's. All right, so with that he's immediately going to. Yeah, he still has his arms free. He's gonna cast. Finger of that kind of like hand on him.

Just be like and so I will say find the thing first off, although mage player I'm grappling himself. Oh yeah. But you don't have any reactions. I interrupted all casting, from a technical perspective, I do depending on what the spell is. You sense figure of death coming second after.

Oh, I would absolutely kind of spell that I prepared it because I knew we're gonna be in comment today. It'd be my second third level. Okay, probably be worth it. So just to say my finger death absolutely immediately. See him do this as he starts that.

And he's going to cast a cold lightning. Okay, I should probably stop that. Yeah, that means that's something you achieve. Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and dispel that, I don't know. Well counter countersville. Okay. Well this bill magic that you'd have to wait on the gas that then yeah, that's true.

Okay, so he you see him wave around mothering something and immediately a over top of you married there seems to almost even over top of it. But well yeah, you think area but yeah over top of 60 feet. Yeah it's 60 feet right? Basically blotting out the slightly sunny arrow, clearing immediately starts to get darker and you hear up above like a crack of thunder, that seems to come out of nowhere and I don't know how this stomach actually works.

Oh, you then you when you cast it and then I believe is action on some sequent turns. You can choose a five foot point. Yeah. Okay. When you cast yourself, she's a point. You can see under the class. Yeah, thank you. Okay yeah. So Immediately I need to see if Yeah, I mean I didn't know how far he was in the first place so yeah, I mean it could just be everybody including himself if everybody's just grouped up.

Yeah, how close well so Yeah, Merrick, did you move up? Because I know that I wrote in Bel Thor, moved up towards the stone America. You did tell it where we always went out here. Who's that one? Well, this is better. Okay? Yeah, this is the deal. Okay. Well, where do you think Kadim would be It's a great question.

That is a great question. Okay. Yeah, so move him a little bit away from Merrick well and you were shaking your head when you were asked if you moved up. So, when he technically be farther back? Yeah, I'd be on like, entering the closer to the middle. Yeah, or so.

Right about there. Yeah, so I need you to make an extension through As a bolt of lightning immediately stripes, either you or your near vicinity, okay?

20\. All right. Rather Tell me. That's motherfucker's getting tied up at least. Well. Yeah, I would say, we at least knock them out. He is acting regardless of his mental state. He is testing third level spells at us at 15. Yeah. So they were taking the steps. Yeah. I I'm not saying it's not justified.

I I'm also not saying we should kill him but you take 21. Oh wait, how you got a natural 20 so cut them. Well it was dope well, it was 20 totally. Yeah, it was a boy game. If you succeed. Yeah, let's see a ridiculous.

Round down. Yeah, you take 14 points of lighting down. As the bolt land like strikes right next to you. No one. Don't it is just important. No, they stand. He also shouts after questions. Oh, I mean, I guess I'll let the those that are much closer and or just got struck by lightning act first, but healers does have a finger, who in mind, depending on what the rest of them do.

I just felt I just fell his shit first. How long did that take just, it's instantaneous. Well, it's an action. But yeah. So you immediately turn to the sky merit mother your words and send off your counter. This spell. Yeah. Dispel to dispel the magical gathering of clouds. And as you're doing that, he is still going.

No mmm, no, no. Take my stuff. This step here. Yes, stay safe. Here, they mistaken. It's important here. Please does not use that. Oh, not lethally. Okay. Throat job.

That. 25, 25 hits certainly. Eight eight points that okay, you're gonna have to keep going. Yeah, so he is going to after getting punched in the face, by the woman who is holding. He is going to As a reaction or Well, no, he doesn't have a reaction. He is about to as a not a reaction.

But like as a response we we aren't really in an initiative. Yeah. And I'm trying to do this kind of loosely where people are doing things as they want to. Because I'd be keep on hitting him and he still. Yeah. So, so you're going in for a second attack.

He's also trying to do something. So I will say rolling initiative, real quick not for a continual thing, but who gets their thing off first, your punch or his thing, who gets off 18, he rolled a 16. So your second fist goes in before his before his thing. 12.

Okay, so once again, crack a second time, he seems to kind of and then he is going to Do I need real damage? Oh, sorry. I thought that was the day. The 12 did hit, okay. I thought the 12 was the age four. Okay. And he is going to You immediately lose your grip on him as he becomes a bear.

It's okay. Sorry, I'll jump back then, I guess. You jump away from the stones. I mean, I don't know. He's on top of the stones though, or well, on me, he was rugged, he's running from me. He was grappled by you until he turned into the bear. He's staying right as a bear, it is now standing right in front of the stuff right in front of the stone that you're from.

So if you move back, do you move back? No, I guess I'll just I don't know. Can try to I guess I'll do that with the bonus action, okay? Don't know what to do about him and I come out. So I'll try it. Alternatively, you could just go around the other way and leave.

So now, Because that's true. I'm just gonna dash through Okay, so as America, as you start rushing through

So, 60 feet and well 50. 10 10 and not that. Yeah. So as America Russia's forward, Russia's close to one of this pill into the stones. You watches, the bear, like, shifts is a focus to merit as merit walks by and immediately shifts is focused back to you. YouTube, as you two are, the closest And if you've got your full version, it'll be done.

Yeah, that's that's what I was doing. Yeah. Here we just probably just gonna move up with them at this point because just shaking his head at the home is also not being fully certain. What's happening Kadim is going to follow American rush through once again, when Kadine starts to move, the bear, looks at him as good in continues pass, this known it immediately focuses back on YouTube.

Okay. Then I guess I'll just step back and over and try to go around it. Okay? It's watching. Okay, let's go past it about the stones. And once you get far enough in immediately, it's gay spokes. This is back on your valve or you know, technically disengaged if I'm close enough and walk away.

It's watching you, but And then, as you about to get to the Little closer to the stone, you have right about there. You're about to like get like around past it, you just hear Trust. From. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna share one of. Thanks very long. Okay. Oh word. Yeah, we're gonna have to, we're gonna make a note of that.

Yeah. Note taken in head, That was somebody back in town with the hell that's about. What kind of crazy force known has third level spells? Hmm, or has has access to that kind of magic? Now. And anybody proficient in our kind of help them with it. If he says it out while I can use it.

I'm definitely saying it out loud. Yeah, yeah. Okay yeah you kind of you kind of put your heads together as you start to like discuss it a little bit 16. Yeah, with yeah, I rolled eight again and then at that time about it between the two of you being a bit more traveled around and just kind of talking about like different things that you've seen as you travel around probably and one of the things kind of clicks in your brain.

That's something pretty pretty used by Drew. It's pretty big. Yeah. Especially while they're out in. That possibly liberties on. You definitely, that's definitely a druid of some kind, right? One move on gravy. Yeah, I just don't know what these stones are about. And onward. Old magic. Yeah, it's it's a task for another day, right?

Moving forward area on.

Continuing shelf wood. Yep, you. Ok. Ok just wait. He's gonna shift it. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Get yours. Like go. You just moved out of force. Yeah, belly. Oops. All right, so as you keep making your way southward, you see a clearing grow wider as you continue. Thankfully agree with the description of Eastward.

Well selfish for the second or two should be anyway. You see ruined architecture suddenly looming over you. As you realize that what you thought were trees are actually towering pillars of

FLUT loaded. Yeah. Fluted columns. Those like it's it's the like very stereotypical Greek ones. About that. I don't. And marble up around with vines ingredients, The column. Stand in two rows, marking toward a massive stumped temple facade. The ruins are more and unfathoned warm with unfathomable food and several pillars proper than scattered centuries.

Dozens of the garnishing tree roots, ones their way through the clearing climbing over the tall. The fallen pillars and rupturing the walls of temple. Just for a second to zoom out a little bit to give you a better idea. You'd see that you wouldn't really see into the temple, right?

You see the outer walls and the decay. Huh, there's no more like him in there. To ask the question here. Could I do like a history? Check to see if I remember seeing it and reading anything about like these old woods and a temple. That might be in it.

Yeah, make it a screenshot and listen up at night, eight. Yes. Was not for me, you traveled around a lot and there's a lot of rumors and histories that you've heard over time. And, This thinking about it and having traveled through the area before but never specifically into the the old wood But you did hear about.

Something that people refer to as the mossy temple. Old ruins. But most of you what you can remember were just, you know, kind of generic superstitious tales. None of which really sounded anything more than just tall tales to tell children to, you know, warn them away on the landlord.

Yeah, I'm going to work. Yeah, nothing that really ever struck you as hard fact. Okay. Hmm. I assume is this like an outer temple wall, or is this like stairs of? So thats Not actually wall so that that's actually floor like it. It's it's It's not like that. You see all the columns?

Yes. Like it's it's grass. And immediately, it's like stone floor. And these are killers holding up the roof. Yeah, this is like a wall. Yeah. This is a wall. So, yeah. So we can then probably see that this part of the wall that's ruptured in it, therefore away into the temple.

Yep. Okay, yeah, this is gonna start heading towards that. Just okay, yeah, okay. Well first yeah, fucking speak spear and shield in hand. The spear isn't like up aggressively at the moment. Just kind of like out and ready. Yeah. The shield is kind of just up those. Yeah helios.

Centrifugal it. Yeah, since you're making your way beforeward first once you get to about He just you can't just point out maybe if it's you get to about here. Yeah. You watch as with surprising as much and abrupt quickness. The nearby roots that are slightly protruding from this tree immediately, lash out at you, okay?

And the two roots that strike are one to make their attacks down to burn, down the forest. Fireball. All right. I need that is 18 to hit toys that it would be the second one is a 20, 20 minutes. Yeah, the first one slams into you, right? Dealing about four bludgeoning damage.

And the second one, Does one budgeting damage. But graph us you can and is attempting to like it doesn't get that this round but it is starting to like, shift in an upward The pick me up. Yeah, I'm gonna I guess responding start stabbing the shit out of the roof.

The crap over with you go okie dokie.

This is much better. The lower of the two is 22 22 hits. So that's a text to 22, total band, 22 damage so as the plant up As the roots starts to lift up, you take your speed grasping, both your hands and you quickly like twice shove it and because it's wrapped over ground.

You like a couple of times, each spear through us actually goes like through each section of the root and as you like shove it down, it pierces, pull it up, it rips through, shove it down again, and pull it up with the second time in like cuts through all of them and falls to the ground.

However, you can see that more of these roots are starting to move. Yeah, that's fine. I guess I'll just Don't know what clean try to move into the temple and they can't reach the whole way inside. Okay. You make your way in. Everybody else, you are starting to see these roots starting to move.

They're slowly extending out. Some of them are slowly, extending out towards you, more of them, are starting to kind of emerge in this section, where helios was and you watch as he ran through the, through the back, through the open hole in the wall, he So I like to go, you know, follow my question is, could I do the Dodge to try and you know duck around them.

Yep. And get Bob. Yep. Okay I'd like to do that. So your walk Dodge as a I get in range of them. Yep.

I'm going to be losing then. Yeah. Yeah, they're attacks will be a disadvantage. That's what I thought but sometimes pressure, so once again they all for you, make your way up to here and to additional groups seeming rise out of the ground. Take their swimming over here. The first one absolutely misses with a grand total of nine.

The second one. That's terrible. The second one absolutely whips with a grand total of three. Oh, okay. So you rush more word. You see these two roots kind of lash out at you and you managed to dodge both and you make it through which ones you make it into the hole.

Yeah. Okay. Oh, this is sticking the way. Alright, coming out of like that or the ground. They're coming out of the ground. These are roots. Then I'll go. I'll take the dog action as well. Okay. If all right, I'm so sorry. That's not 20. I'm so Is a really happened to iron today.

I'm so sorry, that's four points of bludgeoning damage for the first,

The second one misses with a seven. So as you rush forward with such a burst of speed, you actually run into the first room. That's still extended reaching for help for but like you regain your balance rush forward and jump over the second route route. That doesn't have enough time to grab you, so you make it in.

So who is But this year because you and at the back, the two roots that were coming out of the ground behind you, Before you move, one is for each of you one for Merrick, which doesn't hit with a four. I'm a lucky boy. Yeah, that does not. And the dean gets hit with screams 11 gets hit with With an 18.

What? Yeah I somehow do. That was gonna happen so I'll do the damage. Yeah yeah. Okay the characters I'm worrying my way through this is not just it. Yeah, I do anything. Well, you haven't tried to walk over here? Yeah, so we're moving first. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do the Dodge, but I'm also gonna have my steel defender.

Kind of walk between the two be in the roots and if they're trying Going to use what attack? Ok? Which imposes? Mmm. I guess. I don't need to Did dodge them because it already involved just imposes disadvantage on the Yeah. So What if it's not a creature? Well, the first one misses with a four.

These others, but this Five and a six. So you know make it look forward to fender actually jumps and it's away from the release has been, all right? Yeah. Do I have to dash to catch them? Why is it? If you're moving 25s. And maybe. To me. Oh, so seven.

Eight nine. I think yes, that's one. Yeah, I don't want to get stuck else outside. Well that would have been 50 feet. He wasn't inside so well you probably Assuming you chose to be in that square. Yeah 15 15 20 25. He could probably get Justin side with 50 feet.

That's what I'll do. I'll dash all ready. So two starts at you without disadvantage one's a two, okay? One immediately. Misses as it would have hit me what your armor class. 13, it would have hit you. But as this root kind of reaches intowards, you, you snap your fingers and the tip of the roof seems to almost just rapidly weather.

And as it touches, you is just breaks because it's brittle and you keep running. The second one is a 17 that was Yeah, so I that is four points of blood turning damage as the second one. Slaps you right across the face. Only one that's not. Okay, so that's four of them because he was the last one to move.

So, the two pop-up ones

What's his on the class? One of them hits him with a 13. So that's another three points damage.

Second one that's not gonna hit, I'm not even gonna bother rolling that tech once in the bag. Okay. Race, can you move him to there?

It's a good. His armor class is 11. Yeah, he gets hit a second. That is another three points and blushing damage and he is grapple And now the funnel hit the final attack. Nope, that's a three. So he is now grounded. Okay, I will fire both the one that's graveling grappling him, okay?

Come on. 12 12, 12, 12. I'm trying to set me on fire, but immediately like the magic seems to be focused on the room and immediately in front of Kadeem. The it blackens and chars, and he breaks free easily enough. His horse to quite literally scamper inside. I'm stamping.

So he has made into This part of the mossy temple. And we will pick up there next. Yep. Sweets, please. Press five. Nothing can be done. She doesn't have that much power, everyone. That was DM making a mistake.
