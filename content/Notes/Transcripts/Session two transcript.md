Calling upon you to. Take part in a important. 

You came from all sorts of different places. With this backgrounds Helios journeying alone from your town. Came across Bellflower who had been journeying quite some time. Both individuals call me through. Various means for the same location or a similar reason. 

Not too far away. A similar situation has happened and both journeying from your recent abodes on a similar trail. Right into one another. Having a very similar conversation. 

Turning on your way. Helios, and Balthar some peculiar happenstance, a small pathway. Following an odd chart. In a similar direction. Not seemingly cold, but the Oracle But somehow draw numbers. All of these paths convert. Till you all eventually did make your way too. The sour vintage a quaints book, nice cat. 

That housed a number of hunters experience. A form of hundreds, the matron of And unusual mechanical map seeking the one that made as The inventor recently vanished from his life Speaking with a linear to Padine. 

What can we win Telling that? You are all called by the Oracle. Because great danger has been for me. What to see if you were in deep. The heroes that you're saw, I test was device. Recently, a wild boar had been Terrorizing, the nearby areas of the highlands killing it will and basically causing as much destruction far beyond. 

Many hunters could try and fail to sleep. You gathered the information, you could You agreeing to take on this? Each of you feeling for a different reason that you needed to learn more about this situation, this unusual calling that has been thrust upon you. Gathering the information, the number of hunters who seem to have some kind of experience. 

You said it out in search for it, Finding us life. And attempting to lay traps for it. We're startled by southern truck battling sued, and you were all victorious in slaying. This threaded board. Though, an attempt to Turn turn the tide to this battle. Came upon me as kids master singer, attempted to in view it with more spring for fighting. 

However, the strength of it that he gave the war was not sufficient. And you six mighty warriors felt it. And took its corpse and offered it. Toilet. However, a bleak warning came from the dying boy. About. You're impending. Feeling at the hat. Sacrifice the board. 

And I'm heading on the way back to the shower vintage, where celebration were promised by the inner people should you succeed in slang the score? And should you be able to change the best of your ability to return? The 200s who were grappling with you as they were like, sensed? 

That's why we pick up. Just sacrifice the boards. You are heading back along the path towards the sour. Vintage Kira is leaving the right with a rather spring her in her step the 20 hunters. Spent walking beside her, The six of you following behind. Pickup. 

Wanted to write about that. I think we did pretty good. Yeah, that's what I have said. That was. 

UC Irish is in the back just like, With like this kind of like blackish blood, just like me. I didn't leave you on the page. 

When you look at my head, That's actually right. 07. Thank you. Indeed. It still doesn't so hard stuff. And speaking of writing, do you not have a song to compose Bard? Yes. I do of which I already have anything though, because I've just got good, remember, right? And something. 

So let's hear it. Oh, I'll be ready. I have a jig. Is that in character? Awesome. 

You do see that Kira is as she's walking She's walking and just fiercely like writing on scrolls hairs and off and crumbles it out, Thursday. 

No. Journeying back. Pictures, a number of hours but you do return to The small town, they're being the shower vintage, and you do see that. Attella is standing outside, keeping the watch on attempting to not look nervous as she kind of taps her foot in nervous. But she sees you and a big smile breathes her face and she wraps on the door and immediately a large crowd, What seems to be quite a bit more than should fit in that building out as they all the town has come out to celebrate their cheers, people screaming. 

Well, welcoming the heroes back, the heroes who slaying the dreaded war 

May, I probably just used to, it was mine, so I'm not doing anything too special. Thank you. Rockies 2 back tonight, and you see that? Both Javon and Tenias kind of walk over and there they tried to give like an acknowledging like not to a telemachine reaches out, gives them a hug and they walk in side since you return, as you can see festivities have already started. 

So The rounds on me and the crowded cheering in, a general sense of kind of spontaneous. For quality has kind of come up with any can actually hear that? It's not just around this hour vintage as it's a little like, on the outskirts side of the, you can actually now that you kind of acclimated a little bit that cheers said, kind of died down from the immediate crowd. 

You can hear that there is much shouting and celebration going on in the town. Okay, so question at this point right now. Yes. So like we're still like in our group and everybody's kind of like around and such right in the places. Like this is like a greeting about 30 to 40 people. 

Now that you can stop and take a look and they were celebrating kind of screaming your names which they know all of your names. I've kind of like acting like people do when they see water champions in combat coming back. They, they like reach out and they're like reverently like touching you and like celebrating another villagers actually walk right up to Mary and they pick them up and they start throwing them up in the air to celebrating a number of the villages attempt to do that with a couple of other you and are not so successful. 

A couple of look like strapping, young babies. 1718 just pretty bad. Get a little over and they try to pick you up but you're quite happy. And they might have been up a bit more than they can do. So, they will go. So they they manage they don't quite have you distributed as they try and they just collapse them. 

I will And the interest of theatricality, of course, is that it's my nature. I'm going to try to do a little tumble by just a quick glance. You can see that these are young Recently, getting to adulthood. And you can see that their enthusiasm and their hearts are in the right place, but their physicality isn't quite up to par. 

So you actually see the, the coming fall come and actually talk to me and your legs in such a way that what the fault happens? Like, right on your feet in a bent position and you immediately fucking roll and spring up and everything because young man are on the ground laughing their apologies. 

But it's a very jovial At first, you can see a bit of like Oh, no. Like fear that dropping a hero. Might not go over so well, but seeing your pediatrics puts them in ease and they immediately get back up and start clapping clapping me on the shoulder or cheering. 

Okay. So before I do too much, I do want to ask if Kara stole your name, right? Is she still standing with us? She is one writing furiously, Okay? And smart and smiling at herself as she. She's looking at the straw of the like, as the top of the ball. 

That humble happens. She's a curiously riding and kind of snickering through herself a little bit, Right? Yeah. Before she goes anywhere, I do want to go up to her and, you know, kind of like on the sideline. Are you planning to go with us to the Oracle or That is my plan. 

Some of you probably know where her temple is, but I will accept it, Okay? It might be a bit expedient. Okay. Okay. That is I think the main thing is that I followed that up with Do you need to be there a certain time like obviously. If you want my opinion, I figured that we would allow the heroes who slayed, the Demon Bar, and spit in the eye of Cedron. 

And as she says that with a flirt, right? You can you see us? Like, she kind of waves her hand a little bit and her voice gets louder, right. Kind of a booming voice and immediately. The cheers of the, the 30 bystanders redouble and you hear the chairs of the city redouble as well. 

And so she conveyed that for this town as well. Of course, we need to have envelope opportunity for people to celebrate the Wanted achievement of you young kidnappers, but I imagine that you would probably want to press on in them, right? Okay. Well, that's all I wanted to know. 

I think I'll go ahead and like turn back towards the crowd and be like, who wants to see what the world looks like. And the crowd is like, I would like yeah, yeah, immediately the crowd. There's gasps on some of them back up a little bit, but then they see as the initial shot was the way they see that, it is actually the heroes themselves to are creating this image and they they cheer, and they clap all the more. 

And they go people, they found something. 

Thank you so much for taking care of this evil. Suction such thing. I'm in the image, the people are sharing and you kind of feel. Fuck Korea by your side when she kind of goes. Now, I hope you understand that as a professional, that's cheating. And banging stories, visually is cheating. 

I just want to let you know magic. Kind of does this but she is smiling. 

Okay, at this point. I'm going to get the mail if I can tell. House. She kind of starts guiding some of the towns people. The initial crowd seems to kind of be dispersing, some of them do finally, and some of them seem to go about to back to the town to the other celebrations that are going on. 

Professional drugstore. 

So inside the tab, she immediately tell her immediately goes about BC and herself with getting drinks. Getting orders with people. Want food is prepared. It's a lively atmosphere and she's racist. The first of many tonight. Three. Cheers to the heroes who come to Palea at this dangerous time, and everybody races. 

Their flag in tears are made kind of mines clinking. And then, like slams it on the table and downs her drink, at which point she looks directly. If you could be and goes started, I suppose it's time for some talented music. Yeah, how's your appointment loot? I mean, and then I will wait, I am not using, but I my character will play a song. 

Healers is going to approach, redeem as he's getting the loot, but before he starts playing, he will point at the drum, when your hip may, So I would like to help him lay down a beat, all right. Could he make a performance check with advantage? Went out to kill a boy. 

3:20. It is. He didn't have a lot of time to think about that. It wasn't, you know, something that you planned out thought about and then perfectly honest. I first you were planning on having this be a. Soviet thing of the drums was a bit of a Surprise butts their beats that helios puts down was while a rather basic one one that goes with a lot of different types of music. 

It wasn't anything pretty specifically or made it is a good choice that he starts on the drums. You start playing a very wonderful song and it's starts slow and it gradually builds up and builds and bills into this kind of almost as though you were reciting a play. The slow stocked towards the boars came The sun explodes in from the cave. 

The conflict that happened, and then bringing it back down silence. That is the image that you need to play with the final. Strum that comes to an end and the crowd just erupts into applause and cheer. Thank you, Thank you. You're ever in meet Rose. Be sure to see the Beatles Meridian. 

Don't forget. The prime meridians are had more drinking his had. Shouts of an encore. The news are closed to me. 

What? Appreciate time for a good song. All right. Well, that happens. Let me see something right now. 

So tell it we'll have in a moment. Make reception check while this is all happening. You're the highest passive perception. Yeah, the roll 7 John. There's a lot married right now. Ira, you're standing outside. Not going in, but not spring far away from. You can still hear the Mary making the the for volatility, the the rather unexpected If I walk, if I can get just 3 minutes later You shut the fuck up. 

I don't need your negative around here. 

I'm working, right? And Mary's hard kind of 

You're standing outside, kind of listening, and taking taking a bit of a moment to yourself to breathe and suddenly feel a present beside that. Text you off guard because it's almost like it was you were alone kind of Picking in some comforting silence and then all of a sudden you feel a presence to yourself. 

About what I got over and it's leaning up against the sound advantage. So, I don't seem to come back. I couldn't help, but notice The football teams are happening inside, but here you are outside. Is there anything on there? Yes, some questions. I didn't really do all that well in battle of this test. 

I just don't know if I'm the right adventure. Or, but To be fair, a lot of adventures feel that way when the stars I can remember. Let's see. And she was rifles through her bag of scrolls and pulls out one and opens it. Ah yes, here we are. 

He was. While accounts I know. Small. Physically meek. Not exactly what people would say here on material. And yet off, he went To fight at the time. The king of the Cyclops is who was attempting to take over the city of Store. Now. 

Wood challenge. Cyclops came to single combat. And would say, Time After Time. To the point that at this point is name was 

He was ready to People, thought nothing? And fun after talking about it. 

Interesting how after trying so many times. Still with. The will. Affected the people, the people who That was focus. Talk that war with the Cyclops could only end in their ultimate description. Whereas, if they did not resist, they would marry me slides. If they resisted David die. Yep. This one small. 

No Who fail? In every Fights in perfect. Who is beaten bloody senseless Near death, on one medication. I've got the ask. Inspired the city to rise up. 

Surprising everyone, including himself. It was not a combat with the Cyclops as he had always intended and I always wanted What's in fact, single combat? 

Yes, it is true that in this single instance, Your car not prepared to be perfectly. 

However, here's another thing that you might not have thought about, The board charged. Being the most closely. However, you might notice as the boar phone, It did not attack Elio. So you went after you Now with your ability to deathly scale balls, you know, A drop where the bows above to take advantage. 

Those, who, if I might Are much. Yes, physically. So, you could very well look at this as a failure. However, I recommend To perhaps. Change your perspective, You would have other angles and even if you didn't think of it as a failure, think about it this way. Every failure is just a rehearsal for success. 

You can feel it 1,000 times. 

Yes, you were called by the Oracle. And yes, many people live here to hold the Oracle and very high stand. You have ever ordered this? 

What would you like to? But what I have set. 

Numbers of occult attacked. One of my good friends and the village as well. But I've been here so Who the fuck is it? Okay. You want to keep it safe. Fight for those who cannot Hits. Then let me ask you something. Could you even with your setback? Against. Could you walk away? 

Leave them to a faith and be perfectly honest with me. No, no. As with many things in life full of setbacks as it is. The only way to make their syntax mean something is You can go back or you can stay. Both of us were on the beach. Forward is the only path. 

I would hope. I will after hearing it. I think it's time for some very What better marriage could there be ads? Super delicately just with her checking him and 

A little unexpected. You find yourself in the middle of the tavern type of think of it like salsa. 

Just making for something here. 

21\. 

Come with me. I'm just gathering your information. Password. One moment logging into now man. Big dick interview. Wiki. Despiteable performance check with advantage. With advantage. And and you can see something. 

Okay, what did you roll? 15? 15, Okay. Add Add 17 to it. 15 1792. It is a very well impressive dance, at the two of them are doing. After seeing watching them dance, for a brief moment to me, you pick up the rhythm and the beat that kerosene to be studying and you immediately start playing music when specifically for that and in a brief moment. 

Other people start joining the relatively small space for dancing. Everybody's having a grand time. They're not quite as seemingly skilled as you and Kieran but people do join in dancing. The festivities go on. Well, into the night. Well, into the more. It's about 1:00 before. The partying, really seems to die down the last of the townspoke of left and throughout the night, Townsville would leave. 

And the new townspoke would come in all to see him celebrate with the heroes. This goes on throughout, It's about 1:00. Everybody's that still here is either sleeping passed out. Attella is kind of cleaning up a little bit. The only people remaining conscious are the six of you and Kira, right? 

Who's kind of against the wall kind of sitting back chair leading back to a little bit. Just kind of 

Is there anything you would like to do? I'm very hard, y'all have, you know, myself right now? Make constitution check. Yeah. Yeah. Just straight down purposefully like not going all out with the drink. Yes. I'm drinking with my wine said, which is not. If you're not trying to get all out, you do not give me tomorrow. 

Air concerts. Things that happen as much as you like a good revelry. After going back, this is not the tolerance. You are also pregnant. Off the entire night. However you are Definitely drunk married. You're higher than buzz, but you're not at blackout yet. Try to maintain yourself. You definitely get a little faster to the buzz and drunk and then you're like, okay Now it's time to to stop. 

So you very subtly switch the water over the hours, you do manage to sober up, You're not going to be up there. 

Earlier. Everyone else is telling. Taking a bit of a fancy to you, so give you some of the heavier shit. Nicer shop, but it's nicer in terms of flavor, but it's also much harder. So you take three because they were very nice. Well, 

You're not really sure how. Terrible. It is currently as she's just kind of like, you're not really sure if she's away right now. Just kind of contentedly lead against the wall. 

Well I guess I was stumble over to the ball and try to find a room taking me. You walk over and she's kind of like picking up glasses replacing like turning some furniture up, right? Turning a couple of notes simply passed out individuals over onto their stomachs. So nothing unfortunately, And she looks like it goes done for evening or the morning too much. 

Well kidding. If I have known that, you couldn't handle your quite as well, I definitely wouldn't have brought them out as quickly as they did My phone. 

Yes. How many rooms are we have? We have enough so that everybody can have a room to themselves if they show feel like it. And as I said before, rooms are on Well, I will take of them. I don't like sharing someone. Doesn't matter to me, either. 

Why? I am looking. You don't look too well. Definitely. 

Insights. You're you're currently unsure if she can stand. I'm sure. I know how this is going to go. I will attempt to ask her first. If you had a room here, I, Yep. 

Okay, so we did get to the answer. I'll call over not too loudly. Of course they would tell Did Kira have a room here Which one I will make sure she gets there. Thank you and I'll just have to pick her up and take her upstairs. 

Please stab you. The only thing you think, Yes, yes, take her off again or something. Then I'll head back down and get a room in my room. Want an individual. And she says, 

Present night. So I suppose technically is morning but I'll make sure that the rooster is done, but it's working though. And I had to walk into a back area, that seems to be like a section for, like office and her own life. So what I'm going to remove is all that I can probably just wrap up. 

Well. 

The day finally arrived for like, 2 minutes or the windows, you all kind of relatively easily come away on none of you were too inebriated but your faculties couldn't be readjusted for the morning. 

You can all hear. The cooking and smell the cooking breakfast food materials, as you assume that pillars, often start to prepare stuff right there. Well, I will move. Before I go down, I'm just going to do my morning and he gets Hello. Well, I have to come home. 

Did you stop in a private room? 

That's a better. Something I did nothing Daniel lyrics there but you remembered all of them, I heard all the lyrics in there. I don't know what you're talking about. The kids called chirping nowadays, is that what's happening here? Picture. For sure, I heard all the words. Okay. You heard what she wanted me? 

It's actually being inside of it. I don't know for you. Sounds right to me. ... Something bad every day. 

Nuclear warning about you making your way down. Okay, tell us is there. She's brought out trying to make some kind of like a pseudo buffet type of deal where she cooks it in the back and then just kind of brings it out. And allows people to grab Most of the villagers that were passed out, are not here. 

Imagine that they're families. Probably came to get them this morning. We look outside, they're just throwing on top of the trash Bob is very interested. Help yourselves. We got any like rare rare meat, maybe good. We can make it Just got to curiosity. How rare? Yes, the more the better you actually do. 

I will just laugh. Walks back. It's about that. She she does eventually bring out what looks to be a rather rare steak. Kind of a because she's not really sure she brings out three of them one. That's kind of like what we would consider a rare steak one. That's a little bit less than that. 

And one thing you're not really sure if she's even cooked. I'll take one that she doesn't. 

She doesn't bat. She got 1 second. So, Anything you would like to do this morning. For the record here is not up yet. No, it's not and Helios. You would know that. Based on your location and your travels. You would know that the typical the temple of the Oracle is about halfway between here and a store. 

Sorry, honey. And as you asked me that, how do I Chrome. Chrome. Chrome magnum. Well, you have to open windows. 

What the hell? Now, let's see if I can get in a little bit. Yeah, otherwise it should be completely. As you got a question about that. A teller brings out a map. And she points out to where you currently are at the He points out where he probably are at the salad vintage and basically mentions that about say about a day to directly about Northwest more west than north is the area of the Temple of the So, really shouldn't be that too much. 

That is an odds. I don't know. It's like one of those. I spy pictures. I want to write it. Okay. Anyway, So about an hour after You all get up. You do hear? 

It's all over here. Adore, open upstairs, and hear something. And Kira is there a little disheveled, like noticeable bags under her eyes? A little like, 

Mine. How do you do? Good. Breakfast. Just kind of like rods and plate. It puts a bunch of random stuff on it. It's surprisingly devouring it with a little bit. Surprising gust, though. 

Saltines soups. Okay, well, I see everybody is. 

All right. Well, I appear to be the one that Burn the candle a little too close last night. Apologies for that. I'll be ready to be off. As long as you are. I think I can make it. 

Maybe don't remember lol. What's your iron? I just feel like Good day for travels indeed. Nothing quite like the light of the sun. 

It's too hard. Well, if it gets taxing, I'm sure that Helios would be more than willing to carry you. I'm just like, okay, it's 6'5 Steps out kind of shakes herself off for extra neck. All right. Well, Kelly. We shall. So let me start on your journey, westward out of town words, the temple of the Oracle, as you leave. 

The town's people come out there. Cheering celebrating some are kind of throwing like flower petals that they might have selected recently. Kind of given it a nice celibate jewelry, farewell wishes of victory. And safety may the five gods watch over you all. Wishes that the oracle will help you in your classroom. 

All righty. So I can make your way homework. Somebody make a survival check to see. Well actually guys, okay, somebody roll a D20 to see how the journey goes. Don't. Steve, I think you already rolled something. This is of very easy days journey. The sunshine easy for most people. 

The sun seems to shine somehow. Well, it feels like it shines brighter here, It's a little difficult, but you do manage to push through it. It's nice temperature, It's not oppressively hot for a summer day. It's actually rather pleasing. The journey is easy, The path is easy to find and follow and you run into, no difficulties on this first day of trouble, You travel most of the day, well, into the evening as if the summer months, present, a lot of light into the later parts of the night and it gets about 9:00 before Kira goes. 

Well now I suppose the question is do we press on or do we break for the night? I mean, would I know by now that like you would get there the next day and plan? Yeah, the both of you helios and alcohol. You would you would have a pretty good idea that unless something happens to impede you you'll probably get there. 

Tomorrow about midday. I think stopping makes sense to me. We're not going to see the Oracle right when we get there. Anyway, Don't people aren't dying this time. So I say, resting for the night. 

Who's keeping first watch? 

Lol, I didn't buy it. 

12 19. Your shift. The only sound that seems to be coming from anywhere, is the sound of Kira scribbling on a scroll again, charging to herself and walking over and going If you would mind. They have to deal. It's ripped, She tries to rhyme red with red. The sentence structure is all over the place. 

You're pretty sure that at about halfway through the pony. You just started to invent new words but some criticism in there. 

16\. I got another, I have nothing else to do. I don't think so. And you look at and curious to sitting there smiling, like it's red. Yes, exactly. What I was talking to you. That reaction was exactly what I was going for. Why? Sometimes, it's so interesting to see how people react to something that is truly. 

Some people. And it's it's always interesting to see the thought process that goes through their mind. Some people honestly from the goodness of their hearts Don't want to cause Upon someone's feet. So they try to They lie. But they it's born out of a sense of All the good side. 

Some people out of the goodness will come right out and say I'm sorry but this is terrible. Some people Cyclone. But it's better. Deceit in the hearts They want something from you, so they're trying to pop it up. That's some people average Want to hurt you. So they'll come right down and tell you it's terrible, You're awful. 

But we're saying I've ever seen, It's always interesting to see how people will react. Not just thinking of Something. That's That's true. That's a good test. It was. I never seen someone be physically ill from reading puberty. Can you hear me? But you asked me. I think it's the He says it was the poem. 

This was Other than that, your watch is unidentifiable. Second one. So Khalid and Val Thor, give me a perception. 

That's just, What you say and she holds it to the both of you. And it's a picture, a sketch attempting to recreate the conflict of the battle with the both, right? And You know, it's definitely a sketch. You're pretty sure that for some reason, Ira has two heads. Kadim might have three chins somehow more wide, as some kind of like a weird, like box. 

Device with like what appears to be like handles for eyes. And helios is just a rock Like she threw a folder. And then, like very broad. Well, and you look at the board, the poor is like looking at it in real life. I'm not very good with people. Drawing to keep it on. 

Posses it into the little campfire. Maybe that was. 

Can you get another one later like that? 

Top level. Okay. I'll look at it. You open it up and then you have to open it. Again. This is a really oddly large piece of paper. It's about half the size that you are, and it's like, so it's the one that like fully. Well, you know, just pick up something when you're younger and then you just, you know, it's have it. 

So like what it looks like him but it looks like the drawing that she did. Okay. Do not tell anybody that I. 

Oh, and by the way, anyone who's looking at Irish, she's not breathing. 

I'm good. All right. Maybe I'll take the third watch. Three watches are four. I was an only guy, I mean, I was like, what are you saying? I mean I guess I don't have to wait. So, Cara is asleep now or Oh boy. 

Yeah, I'll just go out and relax. 

15\. The night is calm. 

Okay, before I left. Where's Carol? Right over there. Right? I work. Where he's winning where I assume, he probably wasn't some point. You seen him download where she was probably sitting. Make an investigation Now that you're specifically looking for that. Nope, that's a naughty one. Well, she's going. So, it would seem She was taking the nights and not really worse in the wilds. 

Worried about us. Take your rest. All I'll see what I can do. Search around. Okay, I will go to sleep now I have trust my large friend. I'm assuming it doesn't start off without letting waste since I rolling that one in the investigation. Yeah. Well, try it. 

You're awake. 

Yeah, I think so. I think that Helios would probably continue trying to search at least phone a while. That is an 18. Not not moving for about now In the next half hour. You notice what seemed to be. Footprints. Leaving away. In the direction that you were traveling. Can you go for a little bit? 

And I would say after we should have walking, you eventually do here? Footsteps, coming toward you? 

Yeah, I guess I'll just keep going meet them in the middle. Yeah. Everything. All right. Figured I'd ask since I woke up for watch, you were going and apparently could even notice you relief. Oh well. Little bit. I even told him that I was going to go to the restaurant. 

That was long as always. You're going to get out, no problem. He sits down to sit back against the tree and kind of close her eyes. Express. 

Morning cups. You all complete another long rest, No problems. And it's morning time. He was actually up before most of you, she seems to be like coming out the fire and the campfire stuff. If that's been in the library. 

That's all right now. 

I'll be there. Nothing new experience. No, we ready? Ready. Somebody roll another D20 and we'll see how it stays. 13, without any 

Pretty good day at travel. You didn't have to move a headwind that you're walking into which makes it a little tired. Some but it's not something that's going to really impede you outside of maybe instead of getting there an hour earlier. Now it's an hour away, It's not a massive inconvenience because it's just a constant wind in your face. 

So eventually. I need to get eventually, you come before. 

What appears to be an outcropping of rock? That has actually split open and seems to have, like a deep crevasse. And you actually do hear. Kira, Muttering to herself or she thinks to herself as she's writing down. The temple of the article is located in a many leaves from the nearest seven as you descended into the chasm, the forest disappears, replaced by steep walls of Krakiwa's rise from the price and vent along the floor of the chasm filling the air. 

Here it is reveal yourselves sweating and the heat exertion 

Please continue that list. Like, rolled up this girl puts her feather coat like bag in the bag. 

Yes. Ignore the text, ignore the text. Ignore the text. There we go. Now I got a back this. Feels like home. I have never been here. I've never been anywhere like this before. It currently you're at the top of that You're like at work, We're have you been before? 

. Yeah, you have to like save me that page of the Yeah, that's good. I like it. I'm traumatizing down into. 

Who's going first? I think I'm pretty good at that kind of thing. Of course, I can drive At least a very least. I'm very lucky. That is true. I'll hope I was there. How far I drop? 

It's probably something you shouldn't jump out. Is there like a path stairwell making investigation? Definitely scalable. It created path down. All right, I'm going to Take a rope out of my bag. 

Should have done this earlier, but Oh, it is prepared goods. I just didn't remember what it was called. I'm going. Yeah, I'm going to take some rope down and take some rope out actually. No. But that doesn't make any sense cuz I'm going down and I don't have any pittance. 

I'm just going to try to find the safest way down, but I am going to, I'm going to try to ready to be ready to fall in cast feather fall. Okay, so you start climbing down, Wait a minute. No, I can just do feather fall on all of those, right, You can. 

Yeah, I'm just going to do that. All right, everybody follow me. And I cast better fall and jump. 

Hero looks over the edge as you'd like slowly fall down. Just out of curiosity next time. State. What you're doing instead of just snapping your fingers and then jumping Fair enough. All right, not 20 for 23 total. It shoots like steaming scalding water out and you go, Yep, that would hurt. 

Watch out for the guys there's everybody I didn't see them before. Can I basically bring my main chance on my cell phone? In case, I see one of my friends Oh, let's see here. We're going down. Down in a tornado round. 

Nope. Surprisingly, she seems to be climbing down smoother than you are walking down. I was really nicer. It's like watching Spider-Man except she's going down and it's like, she's almost like not grabbing. It's almost it almost looks like, she's just doing that She's going down As you're all sending. 

That one of the some of the steam that seemed to be steamed from these geysers Almost looks like something. There's almost like a weird small bony shape in the speed. You all see. Let's see if I can not mess this up. Screen without using your hands. So, I suppose, if you want to stay true, I want to That's it. 

Somebody just spilled the egg. What project testing? And as a You're all floating down walking down and climbing down. You do hear a go. 

All right, let's go deep counter. 

I have no idea. 3 + 36. 

14 and tell it not. 

Before steam method. I don't know how. Believe me Well it's what about women and six degree Celsius. I will go back to that as a Okay. How am I supposed to do this thing? Okay. Haha. 

Do we have some done? 

Everybody pick a D for that one, if you want a D6 to represent you. 

Feel. 

I'm going Steve Steven and I turn it around. Okay, so Who represents each d4? 

I mean, if there's an elbow, 

Seven targets. 

I did it. 

No problem, bro. 

Okay. So we're currently up in the air. So you're all currently floating about halfway. You've all got about 50 ft down which there's still like a 150 ft to Because of course, I did. The first wish that moves will take us movement. It will take care Really to determine who it attacks because there are seven targets, right? 

That didn't roll back. That message you watch as the this wispy steam entity shifts towards Kira and she looks over her shoulder, like, letting go and doing this. And you watched that like, right, is it like races its claw to strike. She actually like flexes and then jumps like, propels herself up, grabs up and then like, let's go and slide like down. 

Further beneath it. So she's gone down like another 20 feet as a reaction. So that's its turn. It is safe. They are currently about, They're all probably about like 30 ft. 

Dean will. Just made it movement. Ellen, DeGeneres, magically lyrics. And I'm going to try to cast from each other. 

The first one is before. The second one is a seven and the third one is a 17. They are charmed for the duration while charming. They they have a speed of zero and are incapacitated Okay, so the yellow one and the green one are charmed. They're incapacitated in the Canton. 

All right, anything else? I don't know how far she is away. Which one are you home? So, I'm assuming that everybody like when you jumped out to fall you're all probably pretty close together. So even I have this spread out is probably a bit more like this. Well, actually you would be walking so you might be a little helpful. 

Hey, you might be like a little farther down like they have to feather fall and you're able to just like, get to sleep and this one because Was basically matching girls with cars. Right. Fuck. 

15 hits. Five, budgeting 

Okay. 

You run over and use like punch into this, kind of weird, almost miss looking form, but right, as you like, get to where that skeletal structure, is you actually impact and you hit something physical twice. And you watch us like, What almost seems to be like bones underneath the bitch are like, snapping and popping and this thing is already looking very hard. 

I'm going to use her. So if I hit it with a blushing damage, I can move it. Five feet away from her, you punch it away from the wall or like up. You put with that second. Overhead black like hammer hammer bowl? You just crack into it and send it down. 

All right. Are you an attack? I know I cheer you. Okay, I'm going to make another one for both action. I had it again, 21. You whip out your foot from the wall real quick. Like to catch it flies backwards and your foot like connects and you watch this like the bone just kind of explodes in like a scattershot where like the bones like evaporate intimates that one is dead. 

Oh yeah. I do have something. I killed it. Yay. And write as you do that, you put your foot back down and you look over at Kira who looks at you and goes. See, I told you. I was like when I do that, you can see a little bit of the life essence just goes. 

Money else. That's it. Nope. All right. Steve, the ones that are affected by your spell. Do, they say once basically, it pops up in like one instance and when they feel their charm from you, unless we damage them or something like that, so the yellow one can't do anything. 

And it is going to attack. Which is probably in range of you because you're all kind of grouped together. If it's falling, I will use my held action as a reaction, then we will make those bear attacks That is 11 and 25. 

They're pretty weak. Almost like the mist is like trying to like, dissipate ready That is, yeah, that was held. That makes sense. 

It's here. Well that's wondering. What's the lowest you control? 

What? Any that green? Yes. 

15, 15, 15 minutes. 

Eat piercing bags. I throw your spear out at it and it pierces into it, and threw it, and there's like a hole in it. It's like body. Yeah, or not. Okay, I so disagree. Thank you. Which goes wide over your head. Ready? That's its turn. I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to continue falling While simultaneously scorching raying concentration. 

I'm going to do the one that just woke up first, We're twice rather. Yeah, Thank you. So, first one that's probably not going to do anything 9:00. 13. That one's going to take Five points of damage and then the other one. Same thing somehow. It's going to take. Two others. 

Steam methods like dark. I'm just going to go ahead and do one each, so I'm going to do the first of last one. 

That's 15 damage to the first one. So you fire out your elder blast at the one that just the closest one that's swiped at Calic that the scorching rate did nothing. You fire off your kinetic ball of energy and it's scattered the mist and skeletal structure through it, It is going okay. 

14, 14, 14. 1990s, 19 damage. Okay, let me know. I will look at it and say, hey actually, for her turn, you watch as Kira actually moves down about 50 ft, just okay. If I can see it, the papers were hiding it. Can't wait to listen to the playback. 

On that one. Are you recording this by the way? Really doubling down on it. All right? And it just disappeared. 10 minutes. Follow your heart. Nope, he gone. 

Who's the girl that got drunk and he's a mom. 

Yeah, I think it was a K, y, r, e, e h, I don't know. I spell everything fanatically. All right, they wouldn't have to if I learned short hand. I mean also be fun. 

You all kind of take a moment. Look around and you hear Kira who you look down and she is now at the bottom. She's looking up. Going Mom, come on, come on. Those things are not supposed to be here and I don't know where they came from. How long does it take? 

200 ft. And 50 meters per second. Currently for the life of better, where mine else is scattered rocks. Like tights, you see a large 

You see as Kira is kind of usering you forward stepping forward. This massive temple has been built directly into the wall of cannon columns, support the pediment. That is carved from the rocket clip. States a marvel Is there a Instagram sits and thrown upon the center? One half standing at the center of the Ford R4? 

Once again she she is narrating this as she's walking coral. You do see a large statue of who she claimed to be signal. And there were format, It seems to be standing in amongst the pills. They are not, they definitely will. And they currently don't seem to have noticed you. 

As you are currently, like, During her narrations. I've gotten. Like before the large kind of river that seems to be gently flowing When she said shit at the end and it seemed like that was specifically at the presence of the men or is that ocean narrating out loud again. 

Yeah, since we were just in combat, I probably wouldn't have put my things away yet, just kind of spirit leaning on the shoulder and Tentatively raise the shield a little bit. There's mentors. They're from the cult. Oh, I read you, strain your eyes and you very do clearly see as one of the men kind of who seems to be kind of, in a guard position, but a relaxed one, as he seems to kind of be just kind of mildly glancing around. 

Not really seeming to be paying all that close attention. He does turn just enough for you to see The obsidian eye with a garnet iris. A familiar simple that you've seen before. I will say I've seen people. Nicole. How do you know that? Cuz the lady that was supposed to give me the scroll of attacked by them. 

They were not great at fighting the ones that I thought. But I don't know. 

I want nothing good. They are such a mind. So do we stop them? Likely to be obvious. I suppose, whether it comes to bloodshed depends on What their purpose here is. 

You seem. What what what was Nick / Mary starting to say? Well, I was going to say, it doesn't matter because I was just going to say you should go first because you're the strongest, maybe. Yeah, I mean I will try to follow Helios. Dentist, before you go, can you carry me? 

Do we have more? Yes, sir here. All right, I'm going to attack them. How I'm going to cast catapult on her Gmod. 

Actually, it's going to be just for the corners. At this point, we can just approximate a bit. Just kind of trying to get some diamond mentional. I I still not fully sure of what we're doing with the map so I haven't planned anything. 

They're all basically in between the pillars. There's basically like a pillar a little bit of space, a pillar, a little bit of space and they're just standing, but they don't seem to be really paying attention. 

Will settle. 

The murdering us? 

I don't. 

With haste, then it is requests reach down and just pick America on my shoulder to jump across the window. I'm just going to go to one of the short pieces where it's like 10 feet wide and just Yeah, you can easily make it. And then, once we get over to the other side of the positive, back on the ground, Molly. 

So, the two of you immediately leap over anybody doing anything else while while you watch them. Those two have run and jumped over Calico, rush up to the water's edge, put your spear in, It's pretty deep. You basically get like your spear all the way in and you're pretty sure you're not hitting bottom yet. 

How do you calculate your running? You're running long. Jump is just your strength score. Oh my God. 

I think I would. Yeah. Make a Acrobatics Everybody that's running and jumping. How about dying nine? You do manage to clear it because it's not super duper far but you do definitely splash a little bit but And you definitely like spoosh and I kind of have to pull yourself up and out, right? 

No problem. Roll your acrobatics roll it. 

My strength is. Mine is one. Okay, so can you you also do manage to just make it. You can feel like you're on the edge of like, where the water just meets the ground and catch yourself a little bit and stuff before, work out reaches out, as he's like, Napoleon itself out of the water, he reaches back, grabbed your hand. 

You make it, no problem. You jump and land right in the middle of the water and you immediately start to sing. However, I told him. You sploosh and you're like, it feels like you're already. Like going to sink all the way down, and before you leave in at time to blink, you're on solid ground. 

Whoa No it's good And you see like as you're like on solid ground you look up and you see Kira, let it go over here. The four guards, immediately turn and go. Who are you, Stacy business? As they start to come to reward. How do you do? I'm Eric Alvarez and we've been sent here to go see the Oracle Get some cab. 

Yes, I mean is a reaction alarm. I thought it's the response. We're here. 21. Intended for both of them steel plate like yep. Sorry about. Those are level four plates. Have covered gives you plus two, AC, I guess range of tags and plus two to deck, saves three quarters cover gives you plus five. 

None here. So you throw your spear out and impacts into the man's back and he still stumbles forward roll furnished its action And I don't know if I'll 

What is the chances? We're just we're just killing the Oracle card. I'm pretty sure Tara said that these people were well here Yeah, it is. Yeah you can take me to the thing. You have for you. You get your jack of all trades. Those technically to apply to emissions are all set to 

13\. 1366. When you use it, what the hell? It's like the thing was like, yeah. I can't blast. 14 does not hit the second one. 24 dozen. The second one. Even with all the armor he is wearing, right? The air managed to find and weaken some of it as it went in. 

We are now up to one of the souls He's trying and run. Watches. He disappears around the vehicle statue of supposedly syndrome and he is out of 

It's the next two soldiers tournament. We all have the same initiative once They do the same. They all run into the temple. Little bitches. My mom just got a new phone. They were worried the minute, they heard the hero, and they just watched one of theirs. Just get all the little back immediately here. 

No, we're not rushing. 

No button running. You only die tired. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've heard it from multiple different places. 

The first place I heard it was. What? Open up. I don't know if it was voice chat or any game, but it was definitely in Warcraft. 

The Glory. I'm going to come in your hole tonight. 

Ignored to look at the words. I messed up. Don't look at words. I can't read sideways. That's probably better. All right. The Ender Chamber of the Temple is dominated by a massive monster of civil. We sits upon a throne at the rear of a cell. The foot of the statue is a rectangular pool, which reflects the light of four large, brassiers into rippling patterns, and seal Five, men clading, bronze, male, and blue and bright. 

Blue clothes are gathered around the sacrificial variety. Beer beer. He's bald Looks to be about his 50s or so, and this man is currently shouting at the tallest of the soldier wearing the kind of nicest looking armor. Please, I bet you you must stop what that wish is doing to the Oracle, please. 

I thank you. I know that you serve Sidra but even he must have some sympathy for his child. Please stop her. And you see the four man? Well, the three men from you running off and they start going. They're here. The heroes are here twerms. Which immediately the appearing leader turns draws his weapon and just straight out back. 

Sick, light back this. The older man goes, why And they all drop a lot. 

... 

Once again, the original four, they all seem to have the same. It's the same symbol that you saw before but I just want to make sure I always say it, right? So You see the sign with the garnet iris? The sluggy color more adorned, man, It's not just like a specific symbol like in the upper shoulder when the other seem to be It's like the entire chestplate is disabled 

Where did my house go? 

Can't spell. Text so Dean eligible, Jezari. And then probably. Eligible. 

Or whatever. Do you like this? That's it for me. How did you get back? 

I don't know, I can hear it in my head but I can't emulate it. Hello, your computer is virus but that's more ignorant. Just my name is Dave. 

Okay. 12. To be honest. Okay? 

Javaris. Jupiter Javaris in Lamar. Wait. Well, let you cover. Okay, at the top. The soldier with the large symbol on his chest, raises, his weapon. 

Did I go one more time? Abdul-Jabbar. 

! Here's the thing. Gathered. So these were the three that ran. These were the five. This is the one that looks better. Yes, because they text me. 

These are the acolytes. You can no longer safely, fire them. My name is Cuban. I am the king of the movie. When I playing Too. 

Fuck. We got fireball. Yep. I only count yourself. Don't have canceled. So basically, everybody cuz y'all are pretty much Along with Kira. Chicken, boom. What's the basic? Cuz this is a school. He's not casting like he's using a squirrel. How do we determine that? What do you mean? It depends on the level. 

I'm on spell. Third level is DC-15. You don't even see him. Blinking analysis. You too failed damage. 

Chickable. So, a massive explosion happened helios. Could mean you both take 31 points down. That's all. So be here treatment, where that is, that way next to the green thing. So he's kind of in the center of the room, He basically like is more or less. Accurate. You don't know what that means, right? 

Okay, in that case. Can I do like a perception or something to see if I could see where the room towards the oracle would be just looking around the room because that would be less of a. I feel like that almost be more of a investigation because you're specifically looking to see where that might be visible. 

Okay. All right. Got it. You don't know. Collect the second one that catches him in the shoulder. I've been chunk of his shoulder just gets blasted away. He got he clutches I'll probably like, say, like if I do have any, you know, do I can I say anything to the group? 

Yeah, I'll say talking. If it's not super long is a free action, right? Like a sentence is a free, right? Hey, something about which we need to get through? Just don't like that. Yeah, and then that's it for me. I'm next is a soldier. I don't know where to go. 

Teleport. I'm a, the first I'm going to go ahead, and then I'm going to go up to Ira and Haste. 

Cuz I wouldn't say too close to AC and then Joan deck saves and you get an extra action and you used to make one attack. Yep. Yep. So use them, use them key points. 

Per action, specifically. That's it. 

Then I'm going to be moving basement saying the next soldier. Nope, not the three that we're running in because they're still kind of those two. So move that one up next to the one that I just moved here. They're all kind of like just charging their soils. Okay. 

But, She's going to make. On Armstrong. 

Call me when you get a lot of sleep. I was 11. Dragon. 

19 hits. Nine wedding cabbage. Real good and you actually catch him like cuz he still like really from the Last and do a shoulder and you catch him like a square under the chin and he watches like some of the teeth just kind of explode out as his head gets knocked. 

All right, I have I'll do another text. That's 12 and then I will use a key point. For a boy. .3. 9:00 your moment. 

Animals. Oh shit. The big boy, the big guy. Tell her Sunday God damn dead. Trying to change what I was going to do. Maybe, I don't know. Well, no, it's good cuz it frees up. The, I was going to spend my entire turn of healing myself, but I may not need to be there. 

Now, I'm going to go ahead, I think, and this is probably the fight for it. I'm going to go ahead and activate my shield wall as a bonus action, so plus a seed, Chill boys and people near she own boys and then they don't have to move up. Sorry, Sorry. 

And then I'm going to walk up next to Ira and stop there. You do still manage to stab into him pretty far and he's clutching his boobs. All righty, anything else? That's true. That's what he is. I do Sometimes. I really wish to learn. Okay, I'll pack laundry. 

The Perry's, both of your, your spear thrusts with a sword. 

I plan to take out the picture. 

Anything else Scout of them, crits, they hit my now, massive soldier move him towards Ira. Yeah. How much moving is that? He's got 30 feet. He can make it. So he pulls us that. So yeah. You have what? 19 AC right now plus two from his plus two from me. 

Yeah, the first absolutely misses the Telegraph sorts that was in the left swing. You actually like, it just definitely, like, almost not moving just like this body again. That's enough for one more. And impacts this guy in the back one. He's almost 12 points of damage as he gets stabbed in the back by his own team. 

Okay, so This guy being in bolden is going to turn around and rush up in Iraq, as well. Oh boy. That's what's your AC not even close. Is this one you have to roll for? Was I don't think I had any of that. I mean that's just kind of how bored worse. 

They don't get a ton of attacks bells, They don't even get a ton of damage spells, They're mostly buffs debuffs. Can I get magical speaker? It would have cast sweet. It's a 20-ft. I thought it was cute. Oh no. I was just, I'd say, guess. Okay, I'll take that. 

I'll just have a second. Yeah, but there's three lights. I'm probably going to suck up all the. I mean maybe I mean something. Do you have? Pick them up. Well, he's doing that. Yep. 

There was 29 help So pay some point As you were casting your spell like you're focused primarily on your spell. As you cast it, you watch as Keira suddenly appears among the three acolytes you watch as like it's almost like watching in slow motion but she's still like moving normally as she picks up all three and now she's over there. 

So, you will not hit any of the Acolytes. You only get this old horse. Is the guy that got stuck in the back, so that's four. Okay, so he falls asleep and then there's running back. There's 25 left. Next would be This guy falls asleep on us. Both This guy falls asleep. 

Minus 11. 

Okay. I will bonus action, inspire Helios. Okay. Little bit like that. He's going to go five and 15 and he's going to pick up that act, light off the ground, draw his sword and put it to his room. And that's what he does. I'm not afraid. Scooping up. I mean, okay. 

So although the dude won't give him cover, if you hit him with something range, don't miss. That's what magic misses for us. I am going to try and you can I'd like to run over here like Mexicali. I got this one. That's asleep. So, in 15, I kind of want to be like about here, so, So what meeting over there? 

Can I see better down that hallway at that point? Yeah, from the current position you can see all this up to this door. Okay? And it's yeah. Okay, cool. In that case, I'd like to do my bonus action. Moving my hex ready? We will go with. Where's going to go with this guy right here? 

We're playing D&D, guys. I'm going to meet you meet that beat. Yes, one of the ones that has nothing damaged yet, right? He gets severely hurt. Like, you actually see that like the armor that he's wearing has like been dented into him. Yeah, I had some plastic through the oven still holding, but you can see the blood, like, pouring out underneath it as the, the metal was literally pushed into his body. 

Okay? So that's the damage to him. Yep. I roll with a 23 for the door. It's a door. You needed like a four? Yeah. And that's six damage to it and blast it apart, Okay? Cooling, the temple. This is the one that's asleep. So he doesn't sleep. I'm gonna magic missile a second level. 

The guy that's threatening the old guy. I don't know. Perfectly balanced is almost Yeah. 

14 damage. 14 damage. He is riddled with holes in his and he immediately loses grip on the old man. Okay. Who is now standing a little days? But hasn't had a turn right already? And then I'm going to move up 30 ft. After four more rounds, you will be very tired. 

6 seconds. I can't stop talking to do that is, dude. The old man, though, I need to go. I mean if you can just run over It's up to you. I mean you can do that or you can use your secondary action if you want to just disagge. 

Right next to the dude. Oh no. To on a person. 19 bus how much 19 19. 

So you run up to the to the soldier, threaten the old acorn and while running you just like jump up and be like a full on Superman punch and the man's face behaves. And you literally feel like the the nose break, the teeth break the jaw break as you push like in and you're pretty sure that there was a little bit of a squish as you cave in the skull and literally punch the brain and the body just falls down. 

I do have plenty of movement to move back in the sky and then I believe I can move back. You should have plenty of room. 

I will attack with the other. Test the unarmed, dude. Yes, he's wanted through the mail. Nope, I don't think so That's 10:00 right away. All right, all three of them. All four of them is a 11. Yep. And then, I guess I'm going to go ahead and attack this dude next to me that is not That is a 14, misses and I got to know first And then yeah, I mean it's all I'm going to go ahead and use the inspire that Steve some kind of reminded me of that second attack It turns like a little storm and like going up like an exploding explos. 

The thing, you're attacking it and everything that everything was in five feet of my choice has to make a concert. Which is 50. Okay, so the one he's attacking this one. Which stupid sorry Which other ones have been 5 ft of The purple. One is. And yeah the one that you're attacking 17, The purple one 13 and the green. 

One natural one. Okay, so then two that failed to take whatever you just rolled as on your bars and the guy that I hit will take 12 from the attack is dead. Dad. 

The Dyson. The numbers are not necessarily matching open. Okay, anything else? 

Sentence. Donald Come on the head. Under. 

55\. Okay. You are hitting that one so you damage that guy 25 He is literally looks like he's about to bleed to death, Of course. Advantage. The only attack that gets closest is an 18 to hit you. You actually just like reach up it like the second attack is so weak like barely holding on. 

You actually just reach out and grasp the blade. I'm going to bed. 

I still have an action. Couldn't do that angry face. Bored. Definitely hurting. I'm having a run like it's all run. What kind of I can't see this. My phone. I want backup now. Now just come back. I'll come back and I will be the one that Whichever one works the most for the green one. 

That is not a sleep. Looks like he is literally about to die for him. 13. Do you do one damage? Okay, in that case, I am going to 

Which one of these guys has not been here? But looks relatively okay? The other one next to the purple one looks like he's about to die. I'm going from the purple one. I got to do the most problem in the face and takes his head off running down towards the door. 

I'm 10. Yeah, you're right from the broken door. You can see that there is another door in front of you, and then a hallway that goes off to your left, right? Okay. Anything else next to you? We are here to help. 

Magic missiles. The three magic missiles rocket in and a blast off an arm allele and as it falls in the last one, catches him in the head. And glass office. Well, thank you. Yeah, you roll with advantage. You still have to hit. But if you hit it's an autocorrect. 

? I got eight. First one. So the adding just now, You'll still add it to the first one but not the second. 

10 budgeting you walk over to this man who is asleep and you see the symbol of syndrome and you think back to what people like this try to do to your friend and you just raise your poof put it right over his head. And there's a thickening. Like brunching splat as you just like cave in the skull. 

Razor shake it off a little bit. Little bit of brain matter. Yeah, I'm going to move over to this one. Don't forget to try it again. Yeah, I'll try again. Just because it's potential to roll less than his hit. I will allow you to roll but the probability of you killing him is almost guaranteed. 

Yes, for help. Love So, breath comes. A moment of silence and the old, the older man who's over by you. Merrick stands up and goes Quickly. Now follow me before the witch, does anything else to eat to the horrible? Please. Any starts running? 

This way through the door. 

But they work for powerful organizations. The fireballs. 

It was an exciting. Stanley up. In the middle. 

Is it only on a melee or Yeah, cuz I just wanted to know. 

Okay, I'll just bash it.
