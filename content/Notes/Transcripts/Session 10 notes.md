Physiological structure, it is blood but it has been enchanted to look like something else. Okay cool as the attended immediately goes.

You watch as Pythor immediately goes. Some like his smiling to a little bit of a And without seemingly knowing where it came from. Picks up, another drink and immediately starts drinking heavily. How many 31 what? And have. You ever heard of it telling them? Yeah. You don't want to show him your gratitude father.

And I want to take my time to show him mine and she takes you by the hand and walks words into Starts walking, you back towards where the rest of your group is pickup. You do here a bit Yeah, I'm just alone for the ride at this point. I got caught in the middle of a situation.

I really don't want to be making this idea. What happens? We bonus the record. This is an insight check on or not 13 13. You can tell pretty clearly you've seen. And a lot you can tell that she has to do this moment. Excuse very upset with hope. Not necessarily upset because of any lies or lack of information given, but she's upset of his reaction to you, okay?

Before long, the rest of you watch as a Nora comes back with healing noise immediately upon getting to the table. A seat is pulled out from Julio's. And you said yeah, yeah. Once you said another attended kind of walks over to take an oral away and she shoots them a very whole ship, very holy.

They look that immediately makes the attendant, go through full deviation like not even trying to pretend just like something like here let me come. Get you, let me go. Get you a chair. Something that he tended doesn't. Come back. Oh yeah. She walks over grabs a different chair from another example, and pulls it over and makes it.

You don't put a record jumping aboard. You don't see that a timer for the rest of it, But yeah, who are you? That is so wise in the ways of science. So, Feasting continues. If there's any conversation, anybody would like to have That just make a point in order is included in it.

Yeah, for the record of it. I do want to truly say thank you for all that you have done for me and for Traveling with My new but also old brother. It's it's our job ma'am. Where that we're heroes. It's what we do. I would have been to a room with that and thank you.

For being my heroes. I'll drink to that. Hmm. She races up her own glass, that's all she cheers. Opa. Would you like some Windex swimming? My fat Greek wedding. Is that what we're doing now? No, she then after the cheers are done, she goes I think that Had spoken about getting some help from my father.

Yeah, I wouldn't bother with him tonight. I think that's why. Yeah. I mean, at least he has good reason to celebrate. This is true Celebrate. Yes. What I don't actually know if I would count this as celebr

Well. Well, speaking of celebrations. Do know what? What happened to your own? Did you mention? Where she went. I haven't seen her all night. I Haven't seen cars, since we walked in. I get the feeling she doesn't want to be around a lot of this. And understandable from what I understand and I'm starting to get the feeling that happened.

Exactly been told everything from an unbiased viewpoint. Yeah. Just shoot a pretty not happy glance once again in pipe. Oh it was once again very heavily like yeah, cheering and drinking. It was Around. Would seem that way. I mean, Who was a? Here. If you don't, Who was your who was your mother Helios?

Different from a Norris, to be sure. I I never knew my mother. Well, she was there. Yes. Didn't you know, I must shifter horns. Just not one of those. Never no merit. My mother was taken when I was very young. I'm sorry to hear that, presumably, never mind. I don't think Merrick was in the throne room.

When Pythor talk the other day about the green dragon. Yeah, he was. Yeah for that I will. Yeah. I'd be a whole party was there for me. I've been here like three times. Yeah, was there when yeah, yeah, because I was there when he was talking about, he's had multiple lives taken prisonly by this green dragon hexi.

Eric. It's something I've lived with from a very young age, right? Okay. Mmm, get to be so. I had a good old model, My uncle my mother's brother. Of course, I think that raised me as he's chatting like fucking family tree. It's all the families. Use of the gods, And I still didn't get a name to put in the box.

And I didn't get a name to put in the box. Yeah, just my uncle Theo, we was a city government.

Kind of wish I could.

I'm sorry that's foolish to say, but You're so.

Yeah, let's wrote pythons instead of python like yes my father pipe, not be walking the grapes, right? Like, As I believe, I've said countless times already, I think you already are more than, you know, or at least more than you will admit to. Appreciate that. You all notice at this point of very loud.

Crashing sound. As you look over and Pythor is standing. Once again on top of his throne holding a hammer. Oh a relative and odd hammer. That looks like it was made for both battle and for construction. Yeah and he's racing above his head and goes yes. Now, that you have Upheld your bargain to save my beautiful daughter.

I will tell you the secrets. Oh what you see this? See the secrets you see. Yes, and he starts. He starts walking towards you. Hammer still alive. Okay, just make a quick little look around for any coldness looking people. I know we're probably not like in, but just see if I can see, I don't know.

Anybody acting suspicionally look. Yeah. Like paint too much. Okay, make a perception. Check you just yield. Hello elephant. Well, just kind of like you do. See that everybody is paying attention.

Nobody seems to be overly paying attention. You do notice that a couple of people are trying very hard to look like. They're not paying attention and no that's okay. Like I get up and kind of walk a few steps from our table and like kind of be ready to yeah.

Speak to him when he comes up to us. Sure you take a few steps towards him and he goes on this. Hmm this mighty hammer by horse hammer. Yeah. Good name. Was made by my father Vulcan long ago, so I could crush. Any who opposed us? The centers the giants.

These just on that. The nearest table, the swing is a little bit too low because once again this like he's like 10 foot tall but likes swinging like this. Is that headline for several people? The table of three that seemed to be not really used by anybody for the city.

You'd seem to be a place for some of the attendance to kind of take a break you, they scattered. Yeah. And they all successfully. Don't get hit. Okay. Okay. Great. If I have one request before, before your responsibility, before your request, this hammer is needed. Needed for when you reach the mythical halls.

The myth of a forge. Florge is in the halls right? Further forge. You need this my son. Any hands it to you about. Oh And look at Helios, she's like, Okay, question. I just hope that everybody at the table. You all see this scene you see, helios do nothing.

You see, a norm change and shocking shocking shade of red. I gotta go to the bathroom. Yes. But you can feel like how to curiosity. Yeah, the right, yep. Very like Noticeable in kind of the general. Right to malt and pythoris stirred up, right? There's a because the minute he says that to you, everybody's like All right.

Those are what the table notice. Hey, the alarming shade of red, that Aurora has been. You also know a very not audible for like the room, but audible for your table as the glass, she was holding easily gets crushed in her name. All right, you must take this hammer.

To the method force seek out. That old amount of mine and he will help you to construct mighty weapons for slaying those little titans. I am trustless to you my son. I've no you can do it. You are my child and my children are Right? And just and to do greatness.

I know you can do it boy.

Nope, the one make a dexterity saving throw. No, he's already handed the handle already. But that's a six you obviously barely make it away as you see him with that last like little too far back. And forward and you just like he didn't still like bumps into you as he falls but he doesn't fall completely on you.

You still managed to get away. Okay crap, I'm falling but he does kind of like bump into you. You do manage to stay upright but and the 10 foot giant of a man, On the table called there is no table there. But He just really. Yeah, so yeah, I thought he was standing.

I thought you destroyed an attendance table like over here. Thought he was not standing at this state. He was walking. Yeah, or he was walking towards you. So, Feel like or got. Nope, that's helios Balthasar intercepting some. Oh boy, there was an attendance table here. The the misaligned handling didn't actually hit the table but it would have hit like the end.

Just they just dived away from the table, and he is fallen flat on his face and immediately there's like a bit of silence. Then he hear a very audible. Yeah. And once again, like every attempt like everybody in the chairs, again, continues to ranking like it's not an unexpected thing.

Yeah. Yeah. That that tracks immediately busy still in the ground. He still, he is not looking okay, he is very clearly breathing but barely conscious. You do make a medicine check That's like gonna go or might be sleeping now at 20 and that's funny. Even then you're not exactly the most proficient at medicine for mortals.

And you don't really know because you never really studied the physiology of a god. Yeah you can tell he's passed the fuck out. Yeah. That one last. Yeah. He just said well once again like people start cheering and you watch, is she like her escape from the balls of the he died?

Just there, she started frequently, she's trying to be quiet. So anybody that wants to make perception. Check to see if you hear her. I mean I will because I'm working next to her. No, you do not get to because you walked away. Oh yes, you have left the table.

Like oh yes, yes, she's been at the table with everybody. Okay to busy snicker, dirty's mouth, or I'm guessing If you want to Nora, has stood up after Pythor passed out, and she's called a couple of attendings over. She's whispering to them, and she's trying to be quiet. So, if you want to make a perception to see, if you hear I don't.

Okay Im so Ira and Helios. You both here? Please. I'm super busy snippy. If you would you so kind if he's on my father back. All the other together doing good, is try to let no one knock on making another. I'm gonna make sure oh, all of the the attention story.

Actually just to see surprising, I think a couple of you you see that once she finishes speaking like there's a YouTube know there's a bit of tension and then it immediately goes back to a very polite way. You watch is like all of the attendance almost give like what is like an attendance version of like the military salute as they all kind of, like, give her a proper like You are in command.

Now, like it's for those of you that see, it's a bit and Specifically would be like, this is how people that, remember, that and defer to people's like sound judgment react. And they all like in unison, get like a very formal like respectful bow and then they all like they were five of them.

They all like, kind of mesh through the grout and if you're paying attention, you do see that a number of say, about 20 attendance? Yeah, all work on. They do eventually get him off and they're like, oh, kind of like, you know, like when people like stage dive yeah, like on their back and carrying them, these 20 are holding him like that.

And while they escort in towards the back room, people are still cheering and drinking and all that's done. Is the hammer? That's a good question. What's your strength, okay. That was a funny ass. Well, that's funny. Well, my fireplace makes painter. If it was tenderlover, you wouldn't be able to To me.

One more so 10, but you are aged two were able to carry it. Okay. Yeah. But you get a feeling that wielding. This might be a little bit outside of your head, you know? But you are able to like and the muscles are like you're not impeded like you can move, but you're like you know I wouldn't want to carry this for a while longer, right?

Yeah. Okay. Like I would probably do like right now. I'll put it on my shoulder type. Yes. So it's not. Yeah very you can definitely see associated that it's easier. But you're sitting there going like it's still not easy. Yeah. Okay. This is gonna put my arm to sleep in about 45 seconds.

Hammer is there like the size of a Dodge? It is a war hammer. It is clearly a designed warhammer splash. Sniffing hammer somehow with it. A button. You did notice, I would say that you, those of you that, yeah, everybody saw, you would notice that it was larger in pipeline than when he handed it over.

It seemed to bring reoriented to the size of applicable for whoever's pulling, thank You like an estimate value. Up, no matter what he's asleep. Horny, I'd say you'd estimate this panner to Be about. Like 120. Yeah, guys. All right. Well I'm going to try to walk back over to our table.

Where everyone is still sitting there staring, I'm sickering, I'm visibly sickery. For the next heliosis checker. Okay, thank you. I didn't, I didn't know you were a son of a python or bounty. When Hillier says, thank you, brother. He has a clearance. Like smartphone is facing as well. He's a guy like this.

This is gonna be a joke that probably isn't gonna die for. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was

I'm sorry that. That he put you both. No offense. You specifically in that position, I will speak with him. That's amazing. I wouldn't that's you. Another sign. I think that's another reason that I need to speak with him. Yes, I think this is obviously good. Be helpful but I think we as for additional information besides just well I think we need to discuss what our next moves will be, but I think it's best left for later.

Yeah if you want I can if you're tired of this Noise. I can have rooms set up so you don't have to leave. All deliberately looks at you. When she says that it was oh well I don't necessarily want to turn down the hospitality, but I feel like at least one of us should go check if here is at the hotel.

She didn't pay it, she did pay for it after all. I think that. Well I don't want to leave her out of it. Yeah. She's part of our journey. I don't think you have to worry about and car up finding you when she wants. Right. Well still I don't know if she should necessarily be alone tonight.

Then that I think I think that I think that goes, I think that goes double for you. I think we should still keep a watchful line and just in case Some days. Yeah, right. But regardless of what, the rest of them, decide, I think of room would be nice.

So it's The very least we could do. And if you're worried about, Merrick. Yes mother. If she kind of curses a little bit of that if you concerned about Would be assailants. There's no safer place than here. That the guards will absolutely be on the watch it that that doesn't my heart's good.

Yeah, I'm sure the ones that were In the procession back here with us. Once we made it safe, we inside. I'm sure they went to investigate into the would be a sailings that I saw. All right, I'm sure tonight, perhaps, more than any other night in recent memory, they whole palace will be on high alerts.

Very good, very good. I say talking completely out of my air because I have no clue how the the palace does it shit. Wait, do you not? You worked here But the first, I mean for next knowledge, the first time I've been in this palace was yesterday when we were all in this palette.

So yeah, I'm a native to the city. Yeah. What was your was your uncle and palace guardsmen? No, I just city doors. You know, that python was dead and still good yesterday, or I mean, that would have technically been the Oracle when I found out for sure. Helios had his suspicions beforehand, but he didn't know for sure until the Oracle was like, yeah.

By the way, you're daddy python. Oh, fuck. I figured. But at the same time, thank you for telling me in the rest of these people that at the same time, these people that I met yesterday. Sorry,

I'm just going to go better song. Once you join in and they give you a very respectful like not of agreement and the you recognize a couple of them. They're actually pretty well known performers. Who travel a relatively known performing truth. They give you like a courtesy bow. They're called the rolling stones.

They give you about as you join in with one instrument. And my root, I think about your loop and you start to accompany them with the song and as it continues on, you actually watch as like as they're continuing to play with you. They all kind of share like a glance and they all slightly transition from the song that they were playing, which is a very upbeat celebratory type of song to a song that has a very heavy loot focus, where it's like the foreground where they all, they're not out of place.

Like they're all playing a company meant and base and like it's all a very nice picture but very clearly. It's like the prominent lead role is the loot but without the rest of them, the song doesn't work. So but once again they fall along and it's a very Wonderful performance.

It surprises, everybody there. Including all of you. Sing us your song. Oh, hero of the Oracle. So, Yeah. Sing a song about not having a song. That's as he does a strumming shoots out of that silence for the record. They're actually is like a flow of arcane energy through his.

It's like a combination loot guitar. Like what a guitar is and what allude is it's like a weird kind of motion. You actually do wash as you like goes from the base of the instrument like all the way up there is like energy transferring and out of it. A casts fireballs.

Okay? He casts he's education to amplify Kaden's loot. Oh, How long would you like to perform? When he sent the song, he's really good at fingering that loot when you end the song, everybody like flaps and applause. Like it's a standing ovation type deal and immediately like the lead of the rolling stones.

Rolls up to you and goodness rolls up. Except that by accident, walks up to your goals, please sir. Certainly you're not done yet, shall we? Continue Of course, there's always more time for songs and you continue to have as one of them after they're from performance. Because something is like, oh yeah, I'm professor kidding.

It's been here since I graduated. How are you doing? Oh, you Wow, I didn't think I was So this continues on frame number of hours today. I don't toy the beast or whatever this goes on for a number of hours, okay. Especially because every time that you start to like slow down the band is like, come on, you're so good.

Let's keep going. Look at, you can tell Kadima at this point in time they have gone from professionals doing a like they were made to do this to people that are like, oh my gosh, a fellow musician. Let's just do a jams. You all five members? That's where they are right now.

They don't even care that they're supposed to be performing. This is a jamshed session. Yeah. He's with another doctor's fingers. So, Anybody else This got once again, let's go down for a numbers. I mean, all be out here, I guess just doing whatever probably until a nor retires. Let's stay here for a while, just Congregating with the party but otherwise, that's I in less than anybody else wants to second.

Go checking up on Kira, but I'm good If nothing's pressing about two hours. Go by after pythons, been playing with the band every day, everybody's in high spirits. Hmm. Well. Oh, rather abruptly, actually. Unseen actually don't check. I'm trying to make it the word of the night on the recording.

What? So, what a hard question to ask and okay, so none of you notice but an individual. How technically, you get, you have an utter seemingly. It's not that she just appears but you didn't notice him. You didn't notice him walk in. You didn't notice him walk up towards you.

But there is a tall say about eight foot tall. Bald headed, man, Kind of dark grayish skin big beer. Who I don't when you notice him. He's standing next to other window and he goes Strong. She looks at him and you would all see. She does recognize this person, She stands up and then she looks at you and this isn't the dude that told me to fuck off, is it?

No. Okay. That was a human okay with gravy. Yep, this is I would say Oh yeah, everybody that everybody from here, recognizes this as a thylian Goliath. Okay, I would say Merrick and Ira make a history. Check to see if you recognize that he's at least a delight. No idea.

Okay, we're like the skin is not signs but you I'm sorry. He's of the wire descent somehow similar different than the ones we've seen in the past. But there's enough similarities for you to go. There's this is some kind of goliath. Yeah. When what kind of work does she look of You feel a look like, help me please.

Or look like you should come with me? 17. Oh, look of. I think you should come Wednesday. I think this could be cool. It's the same way. Got it. Yeah. Now you're left earlier, just in case we don't come back here. I roll a company them and I will take pipelines You pick up pythoris handling and it is just like your friends.

Yeah, you are able to lift it and you are able to, oh my chest. Okay. I thought you were being like I'm a lady just a specifically state, obviously, I'm not picking it up in a threatening manner towards the guy that approached yesterday hefting it to. Okay? So you just so I know what it stands up, helios.

Also stands up and also picks up, python's, hammer, and the liar? No, sorry. Sorry. And the glyphs turns to lead a following helios, also the rescue. Kadim. I will say you will if you see them sound, probably just I'll see you. Everybody else today. Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, I'll take around.

Yeah, and then helios does fall. So I mean yeah I'm not gonna make any yeah. Pretend it's to move so that helios knows like if you need this world around here. Yeah, yeah. So I'm just gonna like kind of keep an eye but I'm not gonna make any movies to move with them right now.

Just watching them. Yeah, they are helios you and I nor are started out of the room of the goliath opening the big doors. Walk you a little bit down the hall and then into like a side room. Okay. And once he gets inside and closes the door behind like both of you, a nora turns to you and goes he was before we get started, I should introduce you.

This is a general valve. Fuck I didn't know, that's not you back to the city general. I thought you were still with the other soldiers gardening, the northern danger places, okay, capable of not better. Yeah with, I didn't want to interrupt that. Anyway, when she introduced us I'm just gonna give him a respectful.

Not it's an honor to meet you in general. Likewise. Yes. Good child. I was until recently, when a number of our soldiers were seen chasing some of the cultists by the river andora. And he gets a really big smile. The contest. They would put to death and their bodies casted to the river.

And I had a thought. We shouldn't stop there. It's time that we get them out varsity. And I came here to talk to your father about this, as I did not wish to go behind his back. But and you can see that there's there's it's a combination of discuss at someone, I once for, you know, Jesus.

Eating that one, I would say that you don't read much from this very hard and you're hard battle hard in person but there's the faintest a bit of as he straightens the faintest bit of I didn't expect that.

But I'm very pleased to see. Yeah, understandable. Everyone they will not see tomorrow's light.

Thank you for letting you have done anything else. Of course, both in the past and today, and what? I'm sure we will do in the future. And he wanted. So bath over immediately. I have to catch a normal bit and you all right?

Yes, I I love him but I don't think my father can be king anymore.

I don't suppose you would consider. Anora, the city is yours as much as it is. My home and I love it. I do have other duties elsewhere. She starts up. I will be back to visiting to give you as aid as much as I am able, but I cannot say how often that will be in the coming days.

Looks it up and down kind of tries to give you like some kind of salute that she's relatively seen gladiators, do after a match, a shine of respect, she doesn't really quite get it quite right. It's fine. And she goes. Know this brother. When you come back, this city will be better than a husband.

I hope I have complete faith in your skills in the world to give you a big hug. Coming back to you all while that was happening. Well, all about four. So you're pipe or son. Are you Thank you, Mary for doing what? I'm not there to do. No other.

Who are your parents? You're from? You're from here, aren't you? People hate drugs, Gloria. And what hilliers would say if we were here, So then where your parents gladiators or mortals are they were neither. What's what's common in? Metros then. Yeah, because they only two things in a story are gladiators and articles.

I'm new here, man. Fair enough. I Mmm, my family. Was part of like the world family. There. Interesting. Not not like

Not part of like a raw family but also you're like a nobleman

And I'm not very good. All this long, very wheels. What so that must have been must have been a great honor when you were sent message by the Oracle And it received a message. On. How did you find your way here?

I got send message by someone else. Heard me talk about the faith, right? That's where I got my message. I say, so it was somewhat of your destiny to become to join us then, Maybe, I'm not sure on that. Well, do you believe that you can change your face?

They certainly have. Just to cut across the real quick life. Did she met a meditation? You favorite not fits. Thank you. Yeah, always thankful. Oh yeah. In the meta you've heard both. Oh yeah right. Yes specifically about over. Yeah fake thank you. Oh yeah.

Hmm, that's very interested. I'm still getting new. So this this whole round, it's something like I've never seen before. This is definitely been red. Hear that, I'll tell you all unknown. So I'll tell you what though if I'm being perfectly honest I'll get kind of quiet. I don't trust that cult for one minute.

And I'm surprised that they didn't catch on to our plan earlier. Music. Just fucking right. Can. And, They also wouldn't be able to, Say don't. Well I mean do you think that there's anything we need to be concerned about? I'm sure there is A very worried about retaliation in particular, even if even if it is just happenstance, Probably more.

Well, well that's that's what I'm saying. It just doesn't seem like they just sit on their hands in this time. But seeing how they just kind of went back to hiding? At least for me, draws some concern, Felt something necessarily hiding. Maybe figuring out what it goes from here because we questioned, we knew that guy us was bound by the same pack, right?

Like we could tell. Yeah he is bound by the same is like car in them. Well no. Well in the meadow the gods are bound by the pain. Yeah. But in the meta in, correct me if I'm wrong the people that are followers of whoever have special rules as well, right?

Well, I thought I thought we've seen that because I thought that's why, that's what Kara was pretty was implying. As to, the reason, why Pythor wouldn't take action was because if the, if the beasts were, but pythor couldn't, because he is a god and bound by. Yeah. But I thought he couldn't send anybody out because he couldn't tell his followers to fight followers of Sidron.

And he thought that those the beasts were followers of Sidron. I thought, that's what was implied. That's right. This is up on the right page, I can never remember that. Yeah, well, I mean, I have the same thought, right? Okay. Other no granted. It was all implied so we don't.

It wasn't ever said. Yeah, I don't think it was but I thought that was important. This is how you, yeah. Royal family. Mmm.

Forgot. Where is your family? Basically, a normally receivable who are your parents done, could even kid him still over places, Well, you at least must be excited to go to the Metro Fordge

Is that is Away from Here. Yeah, I could go first changes scenery. I mean, is that is is that where you're from? And now I'm not from the airport. Certainly a place where I want to go. I do have to make a stop before, right? Pause real quick in the map.

Yeah. Yeah. Told you that the oath of peace is one where a powerful creature demands that the person's going to earth will commit no violence against them or any of their servants. Yeah, so but God's can't directly act so pythor. Can't go to the centaurs and slaughter them like he could.

Because as far as he knows, the centers are servants of syndrome. Similarly, citron can't appear in the center of the city and just nights my people that are servants a python. So they specifically can't Their friends. Thank you. They can slaughter atheists but not Followers order that you can follow guys that are guided here into the past, okay.

Does and does that imply that the followers are also bound? Okay. No. It's clearly seeing that the culture. We've been attacked by cultism all the times. Okay, well, yeah, but you can consider, so let's put it this way. The gods themselves are bad. Like, pythor, cannot go to guidance right now and kill.

Yeah, because he's a servant of syndrome just like syndrome. Cannot go to, for example, general fart. Yeah, and kill him because thought is a servant of the highly. Yeah, I'm starving. Yes. Oh, you know, he was just awesome job. So, okay, the old has nothing to do with the certain schools.

Didn't take the deal. Okay, well indeed. Well, then in the meta, I am confused because I don't know what understand why? He I guess he didn't have enough army to defeat the centers. I guess, but they can still send their servants to help whatever the hell they want. Yes.

So in the matter, I intimate. Yeah, I got it. Clearly piper is depressed. Yeah, and drinking himself. Yeah, constantly. Yeah. Got it second in the meadow because car has alluded this field in the matter, height, or believes that the scentars are servants of syndrome. So he can't take direct action, he's a god of direct action.

Yeah, got it. He leads by example not by delegation. Absolutely. Especially not now. Yep. But he thinks and again, cars slapped him with this one. He thinks that everybody that quote-unquote is used by Cedron is their servant. So he immediately assumes all I can't do anything directly. Okay, so then last as with the Basilisks, they were just neutral creatures.

Yeah, he could have gone there and smite like a little bit easier because they are, they're in affiliate. Yeah. Okay, understood. Well, then last question. Along that that line So the we're We're heroes of the Oracle and the Oracle is aligned with the gods, or the Titans, or neutral, she's aligned with the gods, okay?

Also known as well she's technically. Yeah but I just didn't know what her standing like if if her birth decision on automatically makes her have an alignment. No, you know once again it's been a while. But yeah I know that the oracle her greatest legion is to the people of fighting, okay?

The people that live here and she believes and has seen that if syndrome and Luthoria have their way not just will the human's. And like the quote unquote good aligned creatures. Yeah, they all died but the neutral creatures and probably even the evil aligned creatures will all just get wipe out.

Yeah. Just because everybody's in the crossfire. Yes. If you're not if you're not a deity then you're just gonna die. Probably that's what the Oracle scene and the Oracle. At the very least. She wants everybody to live. Yeah. Whether they're Good or bad items or not with the Titans if they're good or bad.

She just wants people to keep them flipping more or less just once life to continue as it is yes. Okay, understood. So not necessarily aligned with anything. So us saying we're heroes of the Oracle isn't like oh we're working for This or that it's more like we're working for the people.

Do I have that, right? Well, it's whatever, you choose it to be more likely, Are you a servant of python? No. Are you a server or serving of cara? No. Are you a servant of One moment walking? No, are you a servant of No, are you a servant of Dallas?

Have those technically, the oath has nothing to do with you want, got it because you are not directly servants of anybody, that it doesn't work understood. And I guess, another thing will we're kind of on the subject to keep in mind is that I think we're more so called a heroes of the oracle.

I mean I partially yeah probably because we saved the Oracle from the Sidra and called this but also the Oracle saw us in vision to kind of like bring patients into this world. Yeah. Rather than letting everything gets slaughtered. It's not so much. Here's of the Oracle as in, we're here to do the oracles video, right?

Also? You have no names. Yeah. Also in volatus you currently have no name. So the only rumors that are spread was that the oracle forsak heroes. Yeah, she needs to hear. Oh, so she and back photo. I hope that clarifies things. I'm sorry that I got it here because of the order.

I mean. Yeah, we could be hot this time. Everybody still at the table. You notice that, helios and anora contact with the storm. You do not see pots Nick. You did not see the glide. Okay. Yeah, when we get back, I'll just Of hammer back. You're gonna bring the hammer down.

It's too much. I'm bringing my hammer and again. Okay. Okay. All, but It will be. Yeah, it was That's very good. All the perhaps, if everything's in hand, perhaps we should retire from the night. I'm kind of bushed I was like the watch all day. And you still don't.

I want tonight at Even though I didn't really do anything. Yeah, my lady, I had still prefer. If you had somebody outside your chamber just for security, a trusted guard, perhaps. You may not worry about me. America. There are ever since I was young, there have always been Shall we say personal guards?

Understood is a different where you come from is royalty. Not heavily protected. It depends sometimes they can't really afford it. The royalty not being able to afford protection. Yeah well and sometimes in particular from my home city, it really royalty is there because they're the best fighters, they don't need protection because by definition, they are already their best protector.

Fair enough.

I just know that in my previous travels that gives the this, this whole situation, with the call to just give me a bad feeling. I think it's safe to say that they can't be trusted but I that yes, I don't think that's what else. Yeah, I think that goes without saying as well and so, but like I said, as long as you're as long as you're secure, then I I think I'm good to retire for the night.

Noise about this time Kadine. You finish your last like? Okay guys, I really like because it's been two hours of non-stop. I can't do this on the others musicians like there's some actual sweat that start. And then they walk up to you. They beat like how five brothers in for a little town type of deal.

That is still a little unusual. Over any elven. This person does have the telltale signs of half out of hands. Which makes his century comment, make a bit more sense. Oh my god. I'm getting so old. You know, I'm 32 ago. 30, just not that much older than me.

Yes. No, he's anxious. I mean he might as well be dead. Yeah, if we're being like street performers, these are like You they don't come to you entirely. Yeah. You don't come to they don't come to you you'd come to them. Yeah. Right. Join my pillows as I see them leaving.

There are a number of rooms and yes she positions you kind of if everybody wants their own room, you can't have your own room.

Maybe notice specifically that she does not seem to go to what would be her custom area around. But her room is right next to Helioses and and you do notice anybody that would care to a number of guards. Do you take a position immediately after she walks in? Well, good night, I hope you all sleep.

You, you see, as Merrick always kind of has it around him. He, it feels Hefty dense, but it's such a small little chart, okay?

Just, and as you focus in on it, You get For a very brief second. Almost in like the blink of an eye and almost something that like it happens. So quickly that you immediately forget If you had a chance to change your feet, Would you which moon our glasses rainbows?

You know what they look like? No. Keep my eyes. I couldn't tell you. Developers here, right? I'll just I think I'll just feel it. Okay. Other records. Do you hand it back to network? Yeah I did. Okay no mouse. The password just pockets. Just yeah. Just like, really Well.

Much as I enjoy interesting conversation, it is rather late, right? The risk of Of course, beating you all to death with that. I once again would like to thank you all as well for helping me in my sister today of course. Think nothing of it. And then he always will retired in his room.

All right. Yeah, okay, it lives within us, you only have to be brief enough to see it. Okay, everybody going to the rules, rise up to meet, you know, I'm just joined them. If they're like them to go right up, I'll be there going with the most people, okay?

Because I mean the rooms are equivalent in size to the room. You had to be so yeah, what are the doors? All their, they're fairly sturdy. They look like they're primarily kind of well. Openings of how they open Are there. What is there one door that opens? Yes, A is one door So it's like that.

Yes, it's like Well I I'm not getting on a bed. I'm gonna stand by assuming doors like, in the middle of the wall. Yeah, I'm gonna stand like behind where the door would open. So That will still defend her. It's yeah, so that's apparently what America wants. I'm used to that.

It's yeah, I go to sleep like a baby knowing that we're safe right now. I like to stay up for a while just in case anything happens. But yeah, so probably like a watch is equivalent, okay. Just like to make sure I think it rests and And me up.

Okay. So if you're going first below, yeah, I'll do first graffiti. Yeah. From one, there's no fucking way, dude. All right, you see fucking nothing here. There wasn't anyone? Go I literally always on watch. Yeah, you don't without the same thing. Everything seems fine. Yeah, that's true. Likewise Intervention dude.

The next one. He's a little consequential but thank you. Feel better maybe breed about. Yeah, you feel annoying? Okay, that was something. Oh, wait, her sleep. All right, like I probably left. Okay. Yes, it's not just over here watching me. Enjoy it. Do you want to make it a second one for your second watch as I read his book out.

Yeah. 30 20 the both of you, you've seen nothing But you do hear in the distance and this is false. This is far in the distance. What sounds like. Be shouting. The distinct sound of clashing of steel. And this goes on for about, Whole shit, it goes on for about 16.

Seven minutes. Andrea. And then all based quiet. 24. Okay, just kind of look calic and go. Know what happened? But whatever. I Motionless feelings. Like, I just continue to set up rest of it, like deal within the morning, so, All right. So as everybody sleeps, Merrick come with me, Oh, she's here.

I'm okay with it. If you're still here. And listen with the enemy. Hmm, so I was like, the dance teacher. Like, oh, the three thing. Yeah. Why is it? Alan is our response. What the fucking? What the freak? What the heck? Just freaking happen. Is I just because I just did I just moved things with my mom.

You don't remember it for spoken when that game came out, all of all the videos are like, damn this game. Yeah, I heard it flopped. About. I'm gonna be like 10 was kind of cool when I saw them. Yeah. The little and local from the trailer and then it came out and just all the dialogue.

So fucking cringy. Like did it just freaking do that? Did I move that with my mind and then the liked up magic wrist? Gauntlet weapon thing is like hey we it's like did I just freaking do that? Hey, we It's like this is so funny, right guys? Yeah. I mean we?

Yeah. Yeah. What game was like, edgy? Female protagonist. Right? Cringey. Dialogue. People love this. That's my look one of video. Oh wait, those two things are so specifically. Yeah, it I never really a fan of the genre, would I try to do? Like, it's like person from normal like, modern times.

It's such a new fantasy world. I've never really. So you don't like eSac guys. Then you know? They're cool. Well I mean an anime it's yeah, typically what it is. It wouldn't, you know? I've never went protagonist gets hit by truck, coon, and fantasy purple. I've never serious like one that I enjoy.

I was just think it ends up being so like, Generally tropium, predictably Couple. Yeah, Bellflower and kidding. Oh, and could evil at the same time. Time you're getting on the table. Get the thing up. He's driving steering wheel. Like my air filter. Yeah. Tractor, air film. I couldn't quite tell this big but yeah.

Yeah. It got two. Barrels of angry. Oh, it doesn't sound like a race car. It sounds like something like a two barrel color. Like a two. Oh shit. Got to reload. It's got two. I don't know what the hell.

You crazy you even let your sister go through with you know throw a voice attacking your call, what the fuck would not be everybody wants them. Go yeah don't leave the fucking minotaurs who are threatening to murder centaur That's why there's an army. Yeah, no interesting. Just, don't add that if we're gonna just do it.

Why we go through this whole fucking elaborate scheme? Well, because again, the, the whole Trying to get rid of this send or by challenging, the captain was supposedly suicide. Supposedly I mean, don't get me wrong. I have faith in my ability is, but if I'm just fighting a CR, whatever, centaur war, captain, I'm a level five, I don't know if I can do that.

Yeah, But our forces come by. Don't presumably, even if we had one either singular, or as a whole, the rest of the sentence are like bad. Just fuck you guys. They're all dead. Now, Not fuck you, bro. All right.

We'll see, still It's saying it seems. Reckless. You may be here. Yep, that's me. The same in the membrane Soon. And remember.

Yeah, we should. We should definitely. Well, we're doing next. The thing is I The it's not that I don't want to trust Pythor, but I I'm a little worried and feel that is though we should We should be taken on these these quests from the Oracle on our own merits.

And but even like it's supposed to well I just don't want pie forward and necessarily just hand them to us if that's what he's offering. I mean if he's just offering the direction on finding that but yeah, I mean quick meta comment. He said he would give us information about where to find that.

Okay, right. Yeah, would be I don't want his air, right? I don't want him to hurt himself or us. She make their way to their room, right? So you can be a part of this one. Yeah. In. To read so well again. Sorry that was a week. No we didn't that that's more of a heliosna I will work.

They're gone. Like they are rubble. Okay. There is very clear evidence of burn marks, okay? Very clear evidence of like some kind of heavy impact because not like you can't tell if this was burned down or like I mean, a lot of mile away. Yeah. You can clearly tell that a lot of damage is happening.

Sure. Like here, right. You can clearly see what looked to be bodies on the ground, like that doesn't. Okay, you can clearly tell a number of because you've seen them enough. Now, city guards. But far, more than the city guards in, their are full armor. You see what looked to be about 50 cultists.

Make a perception check. Not damn it. That one. God damn it. And I'm really sure how many city guards I improved them. Let me present. You're not really sure how many calls you don't know numbers but you can clearly see there are more cultists than there are city guards, okay?

And you can also clearly tell the there are city guards like dealing with them. Okay? 10 minutes. Just you don't like, I'm not looking. Yeah. Just Pretty much. I mean, presumably during the casting is casting a spell? Yeah, so crazy. No like I'm not going. Okay. Like we need that exercise, right?

He's head just slowly spins around. Yeah, he's rolling up the water with the girls. No, dudes. It's, he's like a periscope. So if you look through his eyes you can see through his eyeball See I just feel like I should just like walk the fuck. Yeah. So the smoke doesn't definitely bothers census when I can see it, right?

Yeah. And then like so I'm not gonna be like oh you're good, son of a Of the duet sleep. Well, Mostly I slept really sound last night. Maybe it was the good watch the good watching ability, or maybe it was just a good day's work, but I still good, mostly everything.

All right, I know, I think the lady sister For something, hmm, the best couple of nights. Oh yes, rocky, that's been nothing. You had another nightmare. Um, I don't know if I thought tonight. Much, toggle and expose, I don't really understand what she's some crazy dream. It seems to be a lot of that going around the pondering.

Who knows? I don't put no stuff in. Do you not think? Do they not inspire your archital? My build will just never so the world inspires my life. I see, but do you ever hearing music in your sleep? It have any? Yes. Of course, but I mean, I don't like no wake up and then compose something.

Back or I came from, I I'd heard tail of that happening. What state inspired me every right? I'm sure it happens to me. It doesn't have anything. Think his name was Wilson. Be something Wilson. I don't know. But it's a b. And some, I don't know. But anyway, I just figured that might, that's my happened to you say.

And then I'm just making a shitty joke. Yeah, I know. I got it. That's why I said I will mention like When I took the watch, I heard. It's yelling. And it's stopped about seven minutes. And within seven minutes, I wonder why I have an idea. Here, get breakfast.

First say on this project, we know what our plan is. Be well, I mean I guess it if I thought is sober enough, we could talk to him. Otherwise we just have to go out and probably start doing our labors. Well the he said about mythical hammer. Yeah. Forward.

Well, if I'm not wrong, the mythical forage was one of our stops. So I said, no, yes. So I mean, I seen a recent why we can't start there. Why leave, if he has more information to give us, oh, I'm not saying we should leave. I'm just saying I I think regardless it dependent on our distance that might be our good first stop.

Well. Or the mentoral forge in the what was the dragon's horn. Not both in the city believe is what we were told from what you know the myth reportage. You can find information about the medical forge in the city. Okay? And from what you were told the All right.

What you were told that the horn of balmitra was is supposedly in this. Oh good. So yes. We, we have at least then at least one and a half of the flavors here. Right? Was it legitimate Mom So in Obama drink from the horn of bulk mitra. Yeah L and YT are IA.

Thank you, trading point for me, a good lead. Well, maybe not perhaps, Depends on what kind of stuff. Yeah I think our first step will be to Talk with a nor of she will. I guess be best in the Louvre about whether Father will be in a state in which we can speak with him.

I do want to talk to him before. Too long, but you know that as well. Yeah, we may swim away as well. See while we're here in the palace. Come in. I assume I'm probably still the closest of it doors or you open it and it's okay. Okay. Oh, just talking about.

You actually, if you Come in, feel free. Sure. Steps in. I know it's And make a blades or in the morning, but if you all want, I'll have breakfast, is something we can absolutely figure out. I'm pretty sure. There's at the very least, something left over from That's nice.

That's good to me, good. I thought I should let you know, they took care of it. I figured it was much good today. Here, what they took care of Pythor? To deserve the call. Odd. That's not all I thought you were talking about as a this time Balthazar. Yeah.

All right. There because I guess I'll show up. Check them out. Yeah. Oh that must be what I Yeah, that was my assumption. What would you be care of? And that's nice. I'm just gonna mime like smashing with that hammer lesson. One of the kitchens

He came to the table. Like, I think he was a little preoccupied with wonderful music. A man by the name of that. Came to talk to me. He was. Under the feeling that given how the reasons endeavor is difficult war bound, that it is time to remove them. Want.

That is approval of. State. So he came looking for money as the next. She kind of reached tries to stand a little straighter. It's the next leader of this city. If I agree. Which I did. So I as far as I know and he can't confirm that, he returned this morning, he rounded up a number of his soldiers, his particular grenade and they assaulted the well-known theme of the cultists It's wrong.

Even better. I'm confirmed from back off that about 40 to 50 if they're cult. Pay perish. We're saying to say that we lost a number of our townsguard, from the assault. Fortunately, our losses were much lower on. But guys was not there. Of course we couldn't be so lucky.

To be honest, I feel like we might have been kind of lucky in the fact that he wasn't there, right? I've feared that the number of casualties would have probably promised Well, certainly though. If he remains alive, which I would certainly make that assumption since he wasn't there, say he will likely prove to continue to be a thorn in our side.

Unfortunately. Did you hear that? Thanks for sorry. Something Hello. What do you mean? Very least, I can say that the first time and Number of years, our city doesn't have The cop here. Just very good not to not too offend, my lady but was that did you think there would be any consequences from that?

I mean, or are not. That is there not still an attacking force outside the gates? That's a rather interesting point. As it turns out. Aunt, Kara came to speak with me about that this morning as well. She went to go visit the centers to see how they would respond to the.

Sacrifice. And it was rather interesting. Um, She talked with their chieftain. Almost his name.

Chief. And They know I believe. He was under the impression that he was here to meet guides to talk about. Travel routes for the cult, through their lands. And knew nothing about. The sacrifice. Right. So it seems that the centaur force Which has. Effectively dispersed. And actually nothing to do with it.

And based on what you told me about, that's lists. And might be another trick that the cult did. So, it would seem Smoking years as it were. To manipulate somebody now pay. Right. Start to starting to get an odd feeling about citron. Honored normals, I mean, he builds himself up to be really, really strong, but it just seems so odd to use.

The use these tactics, the twice now. I don't want to sleep. And by stopping, it was working until now, I know, but it just seems like he sells himself as you know, this man of all power. Just seems weird to me that he wouldn't have that to back it up, that's all well.

Keep in mind merit that. Wall should run himself is very powerful, as he is. One of the titans he himself cannot directly intervene. If his forces and perhaps as forces are not as strong as we are, led to believe. Maybe they need to resort to trickery. Or I mean, who knows deception could just be in the nature of the cultists.

All right, they're not typically upstanding people. Or you may be saving, you know, truth threats or wouldn't there's a true owner? Like and they said it worked. My in this, you know, other players if it works.

Couldn't say all I know is what. That is folding and that. In terms of actual power. Sit around was formidable broke, which for that? At least as far as I understand in this heyday is saying something. He forgot a barrel. And understands great as far as I understand my history.

By looking too. Right, five and the dragon words, go against you. So, I guess Guess you bring up an interesting point merit. That that that is kind of concerning. Hmm, if he only spared so few for this city, Where it would be the rest of that. Hmm. Well, that is something as opposed, We will find out.

Sooner or later, and our journey is,

Right. Okay. When and any case they are out of the city now on, that is the most important as far as pressing matters go. Show you. So, do you know if Father is in a coherent state this morning. I believe he is. And I'm hoping he will be. After.

Cara. Went to go speak with him this morning. Of course you did. You want to go? Should we go try? We most likely should go baby. Yeah, let's see. So far. Yeah, that would be a good idea. I think. Peace of course he's not in his Check the phone now.

Yeah, if it even be confident to be perfectly lost, Throughout within, Throughout would indicate that it's a place of rule. He's I love him, but he's made that place of A gesture seat. Anyway, please she leads you off. Through a couple of corridors and passages to where you gather is pipe, or actual life chambers, and you've get to the door and right about there, you very definitely hear.

Well. Do you know how much of an apps? You made yourself. Yes. Last night Boy. Could even show your son. Some appreciation. Had to make an ass of yourself. And give away your hammer to someone. That isn't your blood. Not that there's anything wrong with Val Thor but you've halted your son because you were so drunk.

You couldn't recognize that. So wait, you're not shattered. I still treat you. We do see in our kind of stuff when she hears them. Yeah. Here is very obviously Making fun of the whole situation as he does not actually assume the valor, was his bro. This is really good.

Should be give them a moment or Don't know. Maybe wait a moment and see if there's any yelling. That's fair. There's a brief pause.

Answer me on. Practice. Do you even know how many children you have? Do you even know if they're still alive? Do you even care? Overall this. Silence. Because I want you to know something. I do know how many you had. Oh boy, I do know how many are still alive.

And I do make sure that they are okay. Somebody has to love them hydra. Especially if their father won't.

You can come inside. There's no going to be sibling in fighting today. Yeah, as I guess I'll just open the door and start walking in at that point. Well, we wanted to give you a moment just in case I do appreciate that videos. But there are other matters that must be discussed.

Indeed, so razor head, brother. To give them what you promise. And for the record, you do see that not like head in hands due to like hangover. But like more of a machine gathering you gather that like a heck of a tongue lashing has been happening and he's not and he's not Fighting back against it in a drunken age.

So yeah, I thought you was gonna say there's a drunken we need to have an intervention but this one. Oh I don't. I mean yeah anyway hey

Yes, he just as he just keeps his head down, I'm just kind of gonna like look over it. Ignore

That. Come on in the promise, they helped us. To help you help them. A man of your work. EDC, a bit of a smirk from Parliament that, when that question said, And or something.

You're right. He looks up. But what I understand the local told you. That you need to do a number of things. That you needed to. Claim the weapons of the dragon laws by the fires of the mythical forge and drink from the horn abominator. The horn is here. In the city.

All you have to do. And for the record, you notice he's not looking at anybody. All you have to do is just go to the drag inside. I assume I would know where that is. You know. You know what that is? You know what that means? You know, talk to aesop.

The keeper, you know? Tell you something. As for the middle forge. The hammer that I Remember, in your possession, It was going to say for what it's worth. I mean, he's not like obviously hefting at or anything but it is once again over here. Leos's shoulder. I once again.

Yeah. Right. Right. The hammer that you have. Was made by my father, Vulcan. He made it for a combination of forging, great weaponry and as a weapon itself.

I don't know where the metal fort is. It was lost sometime ago. However, If you talk to the old man, no, probably have more information. You can find them at Vulcans Hall. Is a rather respectable looking. At least that's what he likes to. Pretend to look like and he shoots a kind of dirty look over at car.

She just kind of looks at him, like Nothing you say is really important right now except for our If you can get them to tell you anything, We're to locate the forge. If that ends up being, as fruitless, as I think it will be You can also make your way over.

That's sorry. Yeah. You can also make your way over. To.

You can make your way over to the dragons too. It's a pop. There are a number of people who works that frequent there. Somebody the oldest claim that they were at the forge when it was taken. They claim to remember how to get there, even if they have no desire to go back.

So, Once again all right here she know what the dragons do. Those are not brokely. You have for before and for the horn.

As for the weapons.

You'll have to find your way to the necropolis. At Telemark. You auto know that sister. Not do. And you're right. They should still be three. Hidden there.

Well, that's all the information I have for you.

Thank you.

Father.

From over there. You bust an egg here. Into just, oh, It started. The general is going. Look at yourself. Thank him for what he did.

Thank you. Of course.

Far to a bit of side business. Okay.

You have to pay attention, You have to know, What the people of this city are starting to not just whisper, you have to know.

You are. Not. The best person to sit at the head of the city. And you can see like he starts to like trying get himself like amped up and you know that I'm not saying this to commune. But we have to be. Aware. And we have to be active about this prideful.

We are running out of time. Before syndrome and lutharia would be able to move in the open. I'm sorry Pythor but you have not run this city. You have allowed it to try and run itself as you eat. Drink. She actually Kyra looks over at Aurora, and are kind of like And wallow.

The time for that is over. And if you're not willing, To be the person that these people made. I think it's time for somebody else to step up who will

And who would you propose to take my place? Oh, wise car up.

I'm not here for a fight. And bringing up the past is now is not the right time for that. I think. That your daughter Nora. Is called. Able. And ready to meet the city. If you pay attention, you would know that the cultists are not in your city anymore.

Not because of your instructions. If you even notice, you do see like he looks up. Hastily and there's a shock on his face. Nor general one of your genres. Would not come to you for this instead. He came to your daughter. To seep the instruction the permission to finally, defend the city against the people who walked in and started to take over.

And with her. Incent. Your city has defended itself for the first time and removed them.

Painful.

Help your daughter become. The ruler this city. Allow her. To prove. That once again. Your children. Have matured to be great in their own light, not just because they are your children.

Long. Three hours.
