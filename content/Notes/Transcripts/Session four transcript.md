You were requested by. 

Leader of the actualize, probably the oldest one here to hurt the temples from whatever. Which was supposedly fortunate. You made your way down into the depths of the temple and hurriedly found your way towards where the Oracle was being held on a water, weird and a sea hat, and a number of other couples. 

Once again, combat them soon and you were able to slay, the cultists and kill the sea hack. Eventually freeing the Oracle with some minor slip-ups. Awkward situation. Harry upon returning to the upper parts of the temple. She had another permission about the request of what you need to do. 

Finding three bleeding, three laborers. Preparing away to actually go out to see to Facebook. Includes about what these asks are. And then she needed to rest exhausted from having another vision. You stayed the night at the temple. Gathered your wits and recovered from the numerous battles, you would have that day. 

Conversations were have in the morning about where to proceed. How do you see what direction to go? I'm there, you scaled out of the temple and made your way east, make your way, west northwest Is the city of the store. That is where we pick up, You just set out from the temple making Words a story where you believe that you can find information about what these three labors might be. 

I mean that's where we pick up. Do you have like a post or something? And we realized you have you have nothing that you didn't have when you went into the temple? I could cuz it is technically an item in the DMV should I 

Me so question. Like so that's all I got to figure out. We happen to know like the way up presume or something. Matt at a well, Helios and Balfour, make a knowledge, check just a straight intelligence role. This is for your trials required. Like, do you recognize where you currently are? 

Do you have like a general idea of relationship between it and 13? Wake me up. Right. Okay, that's the most. Well, traveled of this group you have Okay. Okay, then I'll go ahead and, you know, without start going whatever way, right? Northwest, whatever route I'm getting bros with some time because we were calling them before. 

Yeah, that leads out in your general direction, right? Thank you. Okay catching out. You do travel. The one that is the most Northwest one single path from the temple. Then it kind of spider, webs out, right? Okay. 

I can't think of anything in. I think I just be kind of like keeping an eye out but, you know, just I'll travel around 3 years but just doing that naturally, In that case, if somebody wants to do anything specific I would like somebody from the group to reality, 20 to see how the first day is going to be at this. 

Three, interesting, tracking bike race. All righty. Interesting. One for the whole Moon. Free. You start off and it's a bright sunny day. And you walked for about an hour in heading in the northwest direction before you here in the distance. 

All of Thunder and you look around and you can see big dark, heavy storm clouds rolling in your direction. Like almost catching up to you from Indonesians before long. You are in the middle of a gigantic. Fuck. This impeachment process. Due to the nature of this, there is thunder, there is lightning. 

There's pouring rain and there is incredible wind It is it is a very high level spell. 

I need everybody to give me a strength check to maintain your momentum. Holy fuck, I can't roll the day. All right. 14 17. 

You're having fun. The three of you do notice that while America is like struggling, but making better case, you see that eyebrow is seemingly not having all that much trouble. She's standing up, right? She is being buffeded by the wind as you all are, but she seems to almost be like Flowing through it almost like these kind of doing some kind of light fluid motions. 

And almost like, You need to kind of pseudo-perry the wind away from the the strongest gusts away from her As basically. You're making yourself Ira through your Marshall training. You're making yourself as a aerodynamic as possible Kind of piercing through all here, very loudly a clatter and then You all turned look and you are watching as Calicut is literally being blown away from He has literally like fall into the gun blown over and he's now rolling away. 

What are you doing? Yeah, I'm going to run away, is he from us, again at 1:00, a total of a total of one. He got blown about 15 ft away from me, and he's now Can I help you another 10 feet advantage? Being thrown around metallic. You feel a large hand, grab hold of your wrist and you immediately grab on. 

And you have to, like, steady yourself a little bit. I do manage to hold on to him. You managed to pull him up. I'm also going to go over there and I will, I will cast floating discs. Go over where to where where they are. Okay. So in a few seconds, you see Merrick coming up, like Visibility is terrible. 

Nearly one marathon You was going to say, Just tell him it's just time not to use this umbrella. I mean you can if you squat I guess it has to follow me but you'll just say, take shelter under this or grab on. Take shelter to this holidays. It'll save you from the wind. 

Exactly. He doesn't have to fight. I'm going to try to move since I still holding his hand. I'm going to try to move pallet onto the disc. 

13\. 13. It's a little hard. The wind seems to be picking up, but you're able to move him in front of you and kind of help push him onto the discs. 

You're not there. Well, we're all trying to do this as fast as possible, because everything else on top of it, Okay? You do manage to grab, hold of this, you're on it and your stay. I found the one that can convert 2424, Okay? You all notice that you like you all did notice that I returned and ran and you watched America. 

So you are aware that that is happening. Okay, so the question does Shira with us? Yeah, she's standing in front of you all over the same front of us. Okay. And I've basically get up at 2:00. Yeah. You walked up to her and you noticed that she's not really being affected, right? 

Yeah. Okay, so I think that'll cuz I was good at but I think that answers it all. Well. I think we know where this song came from. Between a week and on the water, apologies. Telling on the water later then. I actually didn't hear on the water like after. 

Yes, that's will be. Difficult. Unfortunately. I don't know about the rest of you. But I think we should probably look for shelter. Currently, she's speaking to Helios about or Anthony and probably try and count for the night. I don't think this storm is going to get much better. I'll look around for some work. 

All of you make investigation checks with 

No, just making investigations. 12. Thanks to me. 

You're looking around and in the immediate vicinity you don't really see anything but belthorne You get an inkling that further off. Almost a whispering area that there might be something usable further up, not far, but still about a good half mile away. Okay. 

Okay, I think I'm just going to yell at like or save these. No, let's go further up, you know, maybe like I might have seen some of my travel through before like day and just keep making my way forward there. So that is pretty soon that you guys are already following. 

Yeah, I'm going to fall. Yeah, I'm going to bother you again. Merrick Ira and Cara immediately appears in front of you. There appears to be something about half because at this point, you're about like 35 feet apart. So, like, even in this yelling is something that is not really feasible. 

Would she appears and goes Bethel or seems to the either remember or seen something a little bit farther up, that might be a good location for camping for the day. The storm doesn't appear to be going to let up anytime soon, So that's where the other three are heading and just maintain on this path and we should be able to find it. 

I hope. So everybody starts walking, you know, Eric 19. Both of you start falling behind helios, the wind is picking up your having a hard job getting your foot. Like the the ground is starting to get slick with mud, you're slipping in it, the both of you would actually be pressed back, you can now look over your shoulder and see it. 

You're all the sex. 

As you lose your grip. On the disc. You have one action before you're going to be flopped. So what are you doing that? Instant, The minute you like start to lose your grip. What are you doing? Get one thing. 

Can't even try to regrab If you want to you can do you have like the like the instant that you know, you're going to like lose your grip, You have an instant to do anything. You want to try and keep from being flung away. Or safe. 

It's a 15. Do you have to see him? Yeah, I mean he's 20 feet away. Boy, all the disc is going to be the way bastard to move. If I could see because the disc would follow you, How far away would you let the disc be from you, as you start like, I don't control it. 

It only starts to move when it gets 20 feet away. You have to be, you have to be 15. 20. Just like, give. You use your magic, my lucky charms, plus whatever. In that, you have a sudden search where your fingers tense and pull and you are once again that a firm grip onto the discount, You're fine. 

All righty. So you've all gone about Stupid question. How many feet in a half? So, you continue pressing on. It's tiring. It's Wearing its taxing. Your muscles are straining. But you continue to ensure way down further and further and further, Eventually. 

Cheerios. That's me because you were at the front at this current stage. Cara. Leisurely walking, of course, you actually from in front of you back down, we're not that far. How far was right? There's What seems to be a bit of an outcropping where somebody kind of dogged a tunnel? 

I don't think it goes that far and I'll come what I've seen. It's like a small Miniature camera. It's not that far and you should be able to see it. It's going to be on the left side of the path. He lays just keep going, and you should see it. 

She walks past you and then down the line realize that information to each person Final push strips. Is it a checker service? I'm going to mix different from my numbers. Yeah, those for me. Yeah, it does 21 21. Still watching. The two of. Helios You Merrick and Ira make it to this little kind of lighting Tavern first and it basically looks as though somebody For lack of a better turn, kind of dog, a hole in the ground, not straight down, but kind of like, out of an angle. 

And it appears to be something that somebody did a long time ago. It looks like it's been like, maintained and you gather that it's probably for a situation's, like, this should storm be terrible enough. It was designed as a kind of, like, a shelter. As far as you can tap what? 

What are you doing? He was looking out You watch and you are watching the the rest of your compatriot starting closer as much brighter belt arcade and cowlick. You immediately see this? See the shining, It's really obscure into the rain but you can see that like in front of you a section just gets blankets. 

And you see that it was not designed, like, maybe like 10 ft of like underground. That looks to be about maybe a 30x30, but it's a circle. Cool. 

24\. I just forgot the spells called like molding based out is too smooth. You're inside. But your disc is not moving. Yeah, I figured I'll play inside the Kayla radio. Not opportunity you all get closer and closer. Let's see. 

Okay. I'm back and forth between us and then rolling scared too. What do you save out or what, You know honey. Anything like this It seems like it was created by magic to me. And I do like our contract as well or someday or history. You recognize things like that, the rulers of the cities mandated that some of their magically inclined individuals would go out like along the trails and make these like, specifically design whether shelters travelers or caravans, you do know that the size and delight the frequency and changes depending on what pass you're taking, right? 

Some of them are more. Well, traveled for caravans are actually quite a bit larger to the point that they can actually fit the entire merchant back. Right? Like wagons at. All right. Do you know that they are stabbing throughout? Throughout, you do know that some of them are a bit better. 

Some of them are more like bare bones like function like this one, right? Some of them have been like after their documentation. They've come back and like they've put in supplies food. Provisions, water provisions. Yeah, done. Some actual like construction, to help maintain it and keep it sturdy and just in case storms last more than a day or and just kind of basically make them like shelters, right, anybody? 

Okay. Okay, Gallery. There's a few stories about these in meters. When I was studying that they would talk about, you know, these being along popular routes. Oh good, It's good to know that it's not anything sinister, then Where I where I've been. This would almost certainly be a trap. 

Oh, you too. 

This one looks pretty forgotten about but not really near any major city, so probably not. And the two I for someone just created it. Welcome, all the same. Did you have a bunch of these near your townhelios? But I'm sure they're probably all admit, I Never really traveled too much outside of the city. 

I said, what I did was Inside. Go album time to time especially when I was younger, but Interesting. But absolutely, welcome, like you said, Very warm. Yes. So question for you, I did that happen like right? As soon as we got on like the trailer or have we been, I'm just kind of trying to get what time and day. 

I would assume it was. Yeah the storm happened about at 40 minutes after you started. He started at like at 9:00. So you've been walking It's been like a good, two, three hours and you are right? Okay, probably going to look American. So, Well, actually, with our equipment, we probably like that tender box. 

Sims. You have enough to make a fire to release dry soap. Anyway, If you stayed on the disc, you probably be in the Would only have to walk the whole way over and then he could just walk in the disc with no longer follow that point. Franz Brush rights. 

That's a thing that would happen. Bronze does not. Okay. 

I'll go over to Cadillac cuz I seem to Like, are you okay like scooching over? So at least flip them over. He's really happy. I seen what she's doing all day slipping. He's within my lifting capacity, so Is exhausted. As I might take me a minute but we can get the chicken. 

Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, you do get the two. He do eventually flip him over Calico or flip all over onto your onto your back, and you're just staring at the ceiling. Now, I will say in a few moments Seeing a little bit slowed, but not necessarily for turned. 

More strength than I do. Yeah, he is a +2 to string. I have a -1 Just bubble new. So you do successfully, make a fire. You start to dry yourselves on a lot smarter. He has. 

Okay. Updated pictures. 

Does she has like kind of red eyes that slightly glow in a necklace? 

So you can you can definitely see. She's wearing like a pendant with a silver dragon looks some broken and you can see like a little pointing out 

It's not the same one. Yeah, this isn't one way. It does look broken. Where's the 20 years old? 30 people. All right. 

Try to close all likely just because I can't I'll just start ritually casting a tiny hut. I'm going to turn the heat up to 78. The time, It's like enough for six people. 

No. Helios cadenium. Making our comment check to see if you know what he's doing. I would say that Ira and Bella. Do you know what America is doing to do know what is happening? 

Okay, stupid, bitch. Other scholars, you've seen them sometimes use that just to be on the safe side. So you complete your ritual cast of a tongue and you set the temperature, you all suddenly feel a lot warmer I didn't like that. Probably rain race, though. Emily. The DMs squints and confusion. 

Is that is that like a bad omen or something? Well, I we have already made quite an enemy of Sidra on. He is the master of storms. Obvious presence here, right? I didn't, but I thought they weren't allowed to interfere. No, what's creating a storm or do? Fair enough. 

It's not as though syndrome himself came to stop us or else we would be in much worse shape right now, very true. The oath should still hold. Interesting. Yeah, I'm I'm assuming by what you said earlier that there was something bad would have to happen to him, He broke his oath. 

Yeah, like you were talking about the other oath. Pretty common here. I think it is. Right, it doesn't give me. And Cara, who is actually been just kind of staring out the tunnel, like, Yeah, I got a golden moral. Something about nearly being. Yes, yes. She turns and kind of walks for events and are correct We myself and The the others, my brothers and sisters, and father, We are not physically able to break the earth. 

Neither. 

However, It does appear, and she kind of tilts her head and he once again, see like the red markings on her face and like upper part of her neck reappear, for a brief moment and then it once again, banished, It doesn't appear as though, Some. There's a redefining. What involvement mean? 

For example. Not that long ago. I would have been able to save those accolades without any Punishment. So it's still not. So saving them, still not considered breaking deal. But I am being I'm not going to better term told off for acting in such a way, which is concerned, seeing how it doesn't appear that this reshuffling of definitions quite applies to everyone and she gestures outside. 

There are many storms that happened in this land, and a nothing quite as powerful. Nora's localiz. That's it. This storm does not spam. 

No, it seems like we'll be making powerful enemies as we go along. So, do you think that all the gods are going to arm or get get ready for war? So is the old sewer? 

I want to say, yes. I hope to say, yes. I don't. I know that. I myself and trying the best I can. To get as many. Shall we say? Irons and fire. As possible. I know that my sister 

Sorry. 

Ballast. How's your own? 

Being the goddess of wisdom. I dare say that she has a great many ideas of what to do. And she hasn't seen it to tell me any of them yet, but I doubt that she's just waiting. 

My father. Seems to be currently preoccupied with things. And I haven't spoken with. 

So I would like to say, absolutely Unfortunately, that would be a lot. 

There's me change. They may get their acts together before. It's time. But Well. That's one of the reasons why I 

So question for me, I think we already knew that the oath was 500 years long, right? We know when I don't know an exact date. 

Okay. 

Can. So, how far did you say? We made it, we made it about 40 minutes away from made it, 40 minutes out, so walking speed Probably made. 3 miles an hour is normal. 

I know it's all what what are you think your father's getting ready to do then? 

I couldn't tell you, frankly. So, if I said to say that, His days of glory are long in the past is it's safe to say, let himself go away, putting it. That's, Certainly not. Interesting. So do you think that he won't have any steak in the in this after the oath is over? 

I am sure he can be raised. But, That will be a job for probably all of us. You don't think you will have any luck with it. Well, considering as I've never met the man, probably not. I see. And that's very interesting, indeed. 

Who knows? I suppose we should all find out when we get there. What is it? Like, And his glory days or recently, always, I thought you said, what is he? What is the city like? The story. It was built long ago before the oath of peace. It is essentially a strong old city. 

It was at least for the Western part of the continent, the northernmost piece of civilization, to defend from the wilds of the north. It sounds exciting. No. 

Yes, there are certainly wild things. Well, I suppose you are not like a Minotaur from around here. They do differ in physiology and certainly in temperament, but things like Minotaur's Centers, largely wild beasts and creatures that are typically aligned with the Titans rather than the Five Guys. 

Has Gloria Dean more attacked recently. If That was about to start that, I don't know, but I assumed it would know that of late, There have been constant rumors of centaur raids and cyclops attacks. You would know that the nearby farming villages have had constant trouble with raids. Not really taking human life, but more so keep killing me. 

I can't even taking the animals or ice cream crops Things that they could sort of get away with under them. Okay. You definitely know that studying military It definitely seems like the reddest the the initial opening movement. A receive or just an all out attacker. What I will relay them in group is Well, the story of itself is not seen anything though. 

The farmlands in the surrounding areas have seen raids from what I have heard say, livestock and supplies being taken. Something is growing. I cannot say what be it a raid or an all-out or sorry, being it be at a siege or an allowed attack. I cannot say. One of our labor service is not in the city. 

Maybe I'm Well, our labor to come terrible. 

Says it's held in Astoria. And then I think it was rumors of divorce that had worked in the midfield. Ford. So maybe not in the story. Some around it. 

Have you seen much better? In the gladiatorial arena. Yes. As a soldier in an army. No, that was Never my thing. Whose credit does it? Thank you. I praise coming from. You, I've always wanted for entertainment and Your sportsmanship and skills. Quite a Mac. Thank you. 

Particularly without your competition about against real. Was a fight for the agents. What's my exactly expecting? Such a short sake, worth to be quite as minimal. Certainly not. You do remember that you were victorious but it was a very hard fight. Oh of course How could I possibly forget, Are you ended up with a broken arm and a dislocated knee? 

He had two broken arms and his nose was broke at the end. 

Well, you know what, to go to if we get you know, attacked by weaving me. Because like this evening. Fighting for betray. 

Well, I will say conveniently have done quite well thus far. The best thing. For the cities. Sounds No, you'll be fine. No, certainly not. Is it a large city? It's not as large as meatros but it is sizeable. 

Yes, I have got the rest of your. You mentioned your study at the whereabouts study. I was wondering if you were thinking about, anyways, to raise the booster at the one, at the academy there. James. Well, I never got go there. The shame, it's beautiful. I was just wondering if you have any day, it seen you or something over 24. 

In the classroom. Always fell asleep in music. 

Like, I didn't do that. Well. It's a cool place. I know them, I didn't have something. Yeah, so understandable. I didn't teach like that. Just music. You got music. Music from my project. 

Choosing to be a musician of them. 

It's like a new or something. At this point, it's probably about like, 1:30 now. Makes a bunch. Well I have I only have some rations. Can you tell if the storms dying down at all? Took something. But, And I'll go back to the door of like, you know, and see visit. 

It's still seen as strong as it was before. Yeah. Make an answer, check nature seem to be letting up. The wind is dying down the thunder and the lightning is seemingly moving on. The rain is lessening, but it is still raining, Okay? Right. It seems that even though, Lord of the storms. 

He might be weather patterns are still weather patterns. 

No, we can't. That was called. Yeah, yeah. Yes, it does. Look like the storm is passed. Okay, time to go back there. If you like Want to go ahead and keep making progress. Or I think it's a good idea. We have quite a bit to go progress. Okay. Yeah, I want to put my plate. 

Keep making some progress with them already. I agree with that, but it's definitely a light gray. Instead of the deep black clouds overhead, Visibility is much better than it was. The wind is not going, It's relatively comfortable, because it's still in the summertime. So, the day is hot, but the, the rain kind of is feels kind of cool, kind of nice. 

It hasn't stopped raining. So, it hasn't become super muggy yet, But as you progress through the day, you do get another couple miles, Okay? Still a little slower than it would have been without the rain, But nothing really seems to impede. You all that much. You do come to the about 8:00 time and the rain has stopped. 

Well, I'll look for a place. Rust. Now most likely It's 8:00 so in the summer months so it's kind of like yeah. So I'll go ahead and look around. See if I can find any plates. Okay, give him an experience, though. Jeepers. Reverse was an order. But you do eventually find a place. 

That's actually relatively dry due to the close nature of the trees that grew up and it's almost kind of like a natural umbrella just to be the closeness of these trees. And like they're interlocking branches, that there's kind of a nice circular area that's still actually drawn, Okay, but it did take an hour and a half. 

Happy now is when it's got muggy cuz I'll bring it starting to get a little Not super uncomfortable cuz the sun isn't out to dry everything but it's still a hit start humidity started. Merrick. I can't help it. It's my body. I don't control it. That'd be a good idea. 

Anybody that wants to be safe inside for the night. Continue this zone. 

Yo Gotti. 72 and 1/2 and we'll turn that humidity down to 15%. Okay, we still want to do watches just in case. 

For helping, if you want to cook, I don't need it. I don't need it either. So I don't really care. I don't need it. I definitely don't need it. I mean, Hi everyone. Yeah, I don't I don't think half of them, right. Oh, this is one of these lights to be a 1%. 

10%? I don't know what you mean, but I'm sure more than 1% of people have dark fishing. Pretty normal for I'm blinded you back in the dark. Until now. Actually that's aren't that blind? Very well. So, my car is going to Yes. So, Everyone goes to sleep, except for about four and talent and car. 

Not long. After these years, the snores, the light breathing is somewhat snored. Falling asleep. You immediately start to feel horribly, exhausted. Your eyes have trouble, staying focused trying fight it, but you just feel them slowly close as you fall asleep. You've never fallen asleep before You've never really felt tired. 

But you also noticed that, The. Kind of a rest cycle that you have, where you go into, kind of like a low power mode to recharge. Seemingly goes deeper than that. 

Steering for sleep feels like, 

There's a question. What is about to transpire has two faces. One individual per person, one likes specific proportion. What is a group Do we want to have each? Because there was some confusion. Last time it happened here, would what the individuals are having or do? We want to go one at a time? 

Individual a lot. So my vote is individual loan because we're asleep Like that one. We had the opportunity to get it. I don't feel like I have an opportunity and blessed like it's like a shared dream type thing. That's my, yeah, That's just the question. I got the group when I found it, of course. 

What's up? I don't know. 

He's something like it. Don't ever even like that. Sure. 

What? The one that's not killed, That's everybody. Give me the general thing. And we going over here. You mean the general. 

To maybe recognize something. Blacksmith. He knows a blacksmith. Fuck. What are you asking? Let me look Well wait. He apprentice once is a blacksmith, Your friends. Similarly, I have nothing about that in Bellefontaine. What just happened? I know. Yeah, I have the Oracle tells them that terrible things have been put on a shirt shoulders. 

The Oracle tells you that you have been bad things have been put on your shoulders by a terrible person. 

We saw a minor car, they could walk up walls. Did you want to check if the vibe works or if you if you wanted to do it? He's got a meeting. Not that you were like a teacher named. Nope. Yeah, cuz I heard a rumor. I know it's Eric. 

, Eric, I'm a little married. I do love it. I'm married. 

Well, I guess not! I have a third one. 

Well, you're just like, who's it? It depends on which one. I figured. :-). So, Can we random one? We're going to the Wild. 

Oh my God. I don't know the problem. Always making sure I'm like sitting in the office with a friend like Dallas. How much you get? I got a week of ISD. Same. Oh man, you guys are lucky. I wanted to get expelled because 

Who are you? 

I sent it. 

Discount. 

Where the weather, Who the fuck are you similar? 

Cream. I altered my sleep. 

No, no. 

You know, I was thinking about an emperor. From STAR Wars. As followers. 

Doodlets. 

I want you ready to go to that with Star One. 

Hi. I'm talking about. 

Oh boy. Oh, boy. 7998. 

Hey, Google. Yeah, if I somehow managed to flub up white, bad enough to get wild magic, That's the only magic I know fishing for once. Oh yeah, I mean easiest to do that on the world. You can multiple attack rooms for cancer. 

Do they take the wild badgers or then you can literally just say, is there a I think I thought there was like, okay, yeah, you can get your feature back. Wild magic roll. So that they were about each time. If you have more control over it, right? That's our point. 

And oh, okay, like it's more likely to do that but throw out free spell, you know probably get a while magic out of them. 

I might think you're actively do a super chaos in a big table. No, that can go very quick. You can search search them all I believe. Bowling. No, I'll give you the new one, It changed when the power went out. That's good cuz I think the internet also went out, so it just forced everybody. 

Well it's yeah, it just depends on how long before which anger apartments usually forever. What power loss? I mean, I don't know when out on Saturday between 6:00 and 1:30 Have your dreams guys happy We all got to sleep. 

You have surgery. Searching All of a sudden. All of you. 

All of you. Well, most of you. I do not have to streamscape the academy, right? I don't know how to spell it. Don't have enough. Don't have a, the app In interest of not gas lighting. Steve, I remember you saying it. The microphone probably just picking up something else. 

Has it off sometimes. I don't know. The microphone also doesn't always fix stuff up right here. Everything because I intentionally did not right now. Well, I said, I remember, I didn't say, I don't remember. In front of the group. Almost see me, leave flashing from whatever you had experience. 

Which own the black and snout. You hear a familiar voice, a voice that is spoken to YouTube. Who are little more. The woman's voice is soft and concerned. So, worried about everything worried about honoring, the gods worried about offending them, worried about more worried about the future, What can we do to make you worried? 

On the path ahead of you all, you see a man standing with his back to you. The gaze is out over a beautiful valley which is covered in wildfires soft freezes. Blowing the birds or something brightly. No. Is the greatest of all motorbirds in, don't you think? Knowledge is pain. 

Ignorance. Puts the mind in ease ignorance. As the man turns around you see, his face is twisted in pain. He's missing his eye. Is missing is now. It looks as though he's trying to screen. And you watch as his face. Slowly is peeled away. You won't wake up, instantly. 

I need each of you. To roll 1D10. Was that actually from the book? What that part? Yes. A description of the man with me. 

Hello. Go back, Stop. Each round. I need. 

Let me. 

Okay, I mean mother, Remember how many rounds you yours? So in the waking world, Cara, watched as Balfour and Kelly just slumped both or slumps over Cowlick, you just kind of fall onto your face. I need help I rolled off the phone and guess. Okay, she actually wrote pretty high friend. 

Her intelligence. She knows that that's unusual for both a half elf and for an atomic She's going to immediately rush over to you. She is going to attempt to wake you up by shaking, okay? And I need, 

That was pretty terrible. You don't wake up from that and that's when I, yes, so that's one right? I miss me haggis. Okay, see that that didn't work and being actually kind of concerned. She's going to You know, that is actually exactly what she's going to do. Because she has a sinking suspicion of what this is actually is. 

So she's going to actually think about her for a second. And bulb or fist up, and she's going to make a melee strike against you. We thought it was definitely pretty. 

What you're wearing? Yeah, that's what I was going to say better question. Did you take any of your shit off? I mean not belt or specifically My ass over here and heavy over, has to take it off to sleep. You don't take any damage? 

How are you doing today? I wish I could do something. 

Speaking of which, Do it for the day. 

That is the other number I have nowhere. 

'97. Maybe Funky Town. My gosh. Okay, so immediately up your mouth opens you scream and you immediately fall in contacts. I do that almost every night. He's got to make a medicine check. That's another round. Oh my stars In a bit of rising panic. She knows that you're not in immediate, you're not dead, You're alive, but she can't seem to rouse you. 

So she's going to go on to the next person which is Cadillac and she's going to do the same thing to you. Well, there actually, I need you to make a whisper. 

Picture kicks on group 66 cars. Get your kicks on brute 66. So up Kelly you are conscious however you are experiencing uncontrollable tremors or chicks. Like your body is almost like spasming, Not to the point that like your incapacitated, but to the point that you have disadvantage on attack roles ability involves strength indexary Are you all right? 

Okay. Maybe I think I know who's doing it. Everybody's in danger. We need to wake them all up. Wake up. Okay, so you fuck off. America. So Iraq. She was going to strike you. That's a natural 2000. So, if I Do I mean at the end of the actions, Okay, so all at once, you get hit, I'm here and you get hit you all come to conscious, everybody make a wisdom safe going on around here. 

In which case you also need to use. Sorry we could eat my bagels really high. I got a dirt bike, Dirty 20, You succeed, You know, 17, 19. You see that palette is like standing above you but he's like jerking slightly. You see Beth are on the ground face down. 

You see car up punching Iowa? Okay. So I repelled so that's Map. But the zero is 10. 90 100°. Okay. Hey technology, wake up and there's a strange woman like asking if you're okay You don't know who she is and you don't know where you are. 73. I think it's experience with me. 

You also get slapped away and you see something you don't recognize, You see a bunch of people, you don't recognize and you have no idea where you are, All right? That's me. 

I don't like the deliberation. No, that's not my option. All right, so Helios you wake up you see madness happening around you where you see Calc twitching you see Medina looking very confused. Do you see Belfa on the ground in conscious? You see Iraq like seemingly standoffish and confused and like stepping back from Taro. 

You see America Kind of What would you do? Mary and sudden where you have no idea, what do these people are or where you want? Confused. But intrigued. Okay. That's what you see, Exactly? Okay. 

Okay, that being the case, I would probably get spare and shield and just be on alert for a potential threats. So as you do that car, it turns to you, as she still trying to like seemingly calm down iron if she turns you but just okay. I have no idea if that is a ruse or if you're doing that deliberately, but now it's not the time. 

Who are you? Who are you? Mary, how are you doing? Is there something to be needed? Yes. How about you have a seat? Just take a seat. Overlapping. I don't know. Yes. Okay. He usually still alive. I don't understand the stop slapping until someone stops me or until he wakes up. 

After 30 times, it hurts. Okay, well, Merrick and Iowa. I understand very strange. Do you vote? We met recently. What is the last thing you remember? 

Here, what you think? I'm a small human. 

Please tell me remember a bit more. Elmira. What's a handsome? A punch things. She immediately looks at you. Here we go again. And you like and she's going to make a mountain. I don't know what's going on here, but I'm happy to be a part of it. I don't know if I'm having to be a part of it, too. 

Well, I guess that's Good evening. I guess that's enough. Hideous, right. The answer. Do you all? Except for you too. Do you all remember? Before you woke up? Yes, What happened? Did you have a dream? So I know what happened, That's something that I honestly hadn't taken into consideration. 

You were all just visiting by 8:30, The sister and wife of Sidra. The other time judging by Alex, twitchiness your mucus. Whatever is happening to the floor. And what I very much, hope is the temporary amnesia of the two of you. You have been stricken by her cursive methods. 

I don't feel very mad. I'm not. I'm actually quite happy right now. I'm just confused. Yes. I that's part of it. The two of you don't remember anything. No, Nope. Do I know that I like to adventure? 

If you're all above a 10, you do, remember to be a part of whatever this is. It seems fun of our Very bad adventures going throughout to seek certain items to help. Save this land. 

You both recently suffered some amnesia. That sounds fun. 

I don't know. It just seems like it'd be fun. I've never had amnesia before. Exactly. 

A talking metal man is talking to you. You've never seen one. I suppose I haven't It's nice to meet you. Very metal, man. You said you were from Monrovia not going to go just to bring it down. 

It sounds fun. 

Okay, I don't know where I'm from. You already mysterious man. Real I don't know. We've only just seen your message. I don't know the meaning of teeth. I don't know. Well, teeth are to each one, That's the meaning of teeth. It's too easy. Do I have earlier if I forgot that too? 

No. It's like, I suppose some reintroductions aren't in order. My name is Cara. This is Helios. God, Nice to meet you. My name is Maddock Elvis. And I'm a wizard. Of course, we know you American. That's Belfor. I don't like, I'm going to try to war slaps. If you I don't know, He is alive, but unreceptive which is Do we have fun, fun, fun? 

I'm fit with the dead Whatever. This is that's we're doing this. I'm trying to say I'm trying to codify what adventuring is without actually saying. I'm getting fair enough, I guess. I'm going to write a question mark and show what they call it. Temporary. Well, you would need somebody that has access to a specific spell of a spell of restoring, the lesser of them would work, the greater would also work. 

Unfortunately, that's not something that I Yes. 6 hours. 

Okay, that makes things much easier. 

How frequently can you do it? To every 6 hours. Okay. Well. Perhaps you might want to cure the dead first. He's not there. Are you sure? He's like not moving. 

You say so? I'm going to go, I'm going to go poke it with a stick. Mary, please stop. Go to sleep now. Well, you were slapping it. I'm just poking it. He is not in it. That is bad boy. He's just very deeply asleep. Right. Send me the water. 

I'll perhaps we should continue to sit here and rest while I palak is able to take the necessary time to fix it. 

I understand this much to be very strange for the, two of you Feels normal. That's concerning on so many different levels. The whole time. Cuz married might not remember but he would still be freaking exhausted. Cuz I I assume this is not long into our rest when it's all like crazy. 

Damn, I wish I could help you to run sleep in 30 minutes. Well, this wasn't I think sex is like water. Can I use lucky on it? Well you wouldn't lately know your abilities. So I will say yes, I mean I haven't used any today, so you know. And do that again, Will blow all three today if I have to. 

I've been doing one more time. 538. At as this all is kind of happening. Helios you the one that's kind of like at the ready mom prepare In the distance, you hear a lot of large allowed but allowed Bible, Robertson loud. Loud loud? Loud crashing? Sound like a giant tree fall. 

And the bubble screens. 

Hey, I guess I'm going to go. See what the fuck is going on? Yeah, I guess I'll look at Kyrin and go. And why? Why attention? I'm going to go home. Okay, I'll make sure Yes. I don't know, but I feel like I need to stay here. I probably should be away from people. 

Up to stay here. But not here. Well, like I said, I feel like I need to stay here. America, as you snap power just goes, please don't know what you just did. It just feels right, I know it does, but maybe we should just for the time being until Kelly is 

Yes. You wanted me to watch over at like pissed up Bethel and just kind of like fireman carries throws him over her shoulder and doesn't maybe just be on safe side and maybe to be on suicide him and her first. You watches like Ira is like digging into a recently. 

Killed rabbit like this is great. Just to be on the same side. Making you wait till the woods you go for about? 15, 20 minutes. And you eventually come to a brother odd site, a very large story. Hello. Look like it's like based on it's like sheer size. This is like crazy seem to just under its own weight and age about seven cultures. 

Substitute. You don't know. They they are wearing robes The robes looks similar to ones that you have thought before and you can clearly see that other seven only one of them is still alive and is currently pinned underneath the tree. 

I feel lucky. So it's kind of it's a mess and it's a little like It's six. As you were perceiving much better job. You do see like certain like the depending on like what pieces? Still like visible? You do see the symbols like the last guy? Like it looks like his legs have probably been crushed, but he's like trying to like drag himself. 

He's also like using like a dagger to try and cut some of the dirt from like below him and he is not noticed either of you due to this circumstance I'm gonna find I guess. Whichever symbol is the least messy. I just pick it up to take back for proof and then just look at the down guy and look at kidding just Have the spear around. 

You won't get away with this. Hello. Right into the neck. Thing. 

On the phone, you 

Make an investigation check It looks like. This old tree has very slowly come down with some kind of an illness and was just very slowly. Eating away from the center outward in just so happened to be the perfect spot because it took over like not be able to sustain itself on that side, and it's own, large shape, and weight, just eventually caused it to break. 

And it just so happened with all different. It looks from your eyes like pure random chance, like bad luck happened to these guys. Wow. 

You make your way back and you can see Cara kind of like Nervously. Like having her foot and it's happening so fast that it's like, yeah, it's like, it's slow. It started like slowly. Go down just from light. Yeah. Oh good. Glad to see that you're back, nothing tossed assembled to her and then hold up seven fingers. 

The spear point still would be facing up since I've just been carrying it back, just mind the motion of stabbing and then hold one finger. Horrible. There was one who was alive. So, well, you would know that they're bad. They want sound good. Well, I want our friends. The one he is. 

Going to get together with a guy is booked after. 

What does stroke of good luck? Indeed. Random check. Okay, well, hopefully nothing exciting will happen for the next couple of hours. All. If you would, Watch them for a moment. I'm going to do a bit. 

And she bashes. She's still holding it by the way. 

Okay, I'm just going to be on fireworks that we've seen, so It's so rainy. 

She comes back in a couple of minutes. I'm tired, Balfour from first place him back. Now I'm expected guests. For a while. At least not that I saw. So hopefully nothing else will have. 

We were targeted by soon. Absolutely. You were all visited by the material. Seguin's wife. And dumb. The nightmarish that she induced in all of you had some effect on some of you? Alex jerking. Balfour's unconsciousness their amnesia. Handle heliosis grand voice. 

Are you holding a dead rabbit? What's going on there? 

Okay. As I look like, 

Little Rabbit will be nice. She vanishes and comes back with two more. 

Just in case. What else? 

Okay. She's going to put the rabbit down. She then picks it up out for a one more time Walks over to you Puts him, deliberately beside you. Just to be honest. 

She once again, vanishes this time comes back with two more rabbits and a wild boar that is still alive in squealing, and she's kind of like I didn't just want you to know that. 

Take the seal heavy instrument. 

I probably go somewhere else for that one. I'm just going to make sure she doesn't want her too far away. Ghost comes back. Is enjoying her views. Go back to sleep. I will probably go back to sleep after even though everything's like shiny and new. You still feel very tired. 

Yeah. I'm going to listen to that and go to bed. I will the Korean wanted. Tyra was thinking kind of stand up after you've been like basically just sitting and waiting for your time yet, you kind of look up. And you see that has walked in a circle of rounds and she is like up to her like thighs from just like going around and around like you know in the cartoons like run so fast. 

Steps out. I have to feel that ready? I hope. Okay. I'm I say either or I rehearsed maybe because we don't want her to go. Is Iris still sleeping? When you awake Ira, your madness will be gone. Okay, remember the fact that you had temporary amnesia, You will remember that you devoured, rabbits in front of Amy. 

Well, also remember, repositioning Balfour to different places away from me? Already. So that's the first of your use as a blood pressure. It is like on the ground somewhere. 

So bad. It's so, Like, it hurts so badly that life moving is just like pain. Are you on our way? You do see Cadillacs. ? 

How do you feel? 

There was some over-exuberant attempts at waking you. Besides your face. Do you know who I am? Do you know where we are? 

Okay. Do you remember? Do you know the text? Roseanne. Yeah, and all that note. 

You would all have seen. 

The recipe box is, the rest was obviously skated by shadow, but you definitely saw her face. 

Oh yeah, I did. And I take her hand and then do the encoded and share with her. 

Very interesting. 

You saw all of this? Including, 

Have you spoken with? 

Well, which Hello. 

For the time, being get some rest. You and I are going to have to have when I will have that conversation. 

For now, get some sleep. Hopefully, this will be more resilient. I thought I'd resume it wasn't like a press for me. No, okay, not even you as a half arrest. Okay. Yep. All right. Another 6 hours go by this point in time, it's light. People are starting to wake up. 

Yes, I would say enough time would still collapse and Cara wouldn't get everybody up early in the morning. She let things go longer based on what happened. 

Oh wow. So you all come awake. One of the time. Called your just finishing up. Once again, your preparation for testing it two more times and you watches palette is like sitting there like appears to be some very unnatural for him like jerkiness and tell you watches. He suddenly touches himself and it just goes away. 

I don't know why. That has got to be a pair of, it's not making it. 

Awesome. You one can't speak and still fight. That's that's fair. It probably be good idea to have Merrick have all of his faculties seeing as he will or could potentially and without fully realizing it altered. Chats. I just feel lucky. Everything comes back to you, All of your memories, Including the fact that you distinctly know that. 

At some point last night, you used a lot that you know, like what? Because you don't know about the truth. Huh. That was just very strange experience. Was that all the dream? I wish. I guess we shouldn't have been talking about the Gods last night after all. I didn't feel. 

I feel like I should be worried. I didn't feel that different Really. I wonder why. That isn't anything Cuz I know the work now It's adventure. It's starting to receive swelling. 

We could not. We could probably get to walking while we do that. We were also Because you did six and six of we've been down for 12 hours and definitely been a long really forever. 

Got that. And I, you know, kind of do my standard morning. 

I was trying to figure out where it is. What is it a half Pepto Bismol or have been liquid? Benadryl? If you take if you take like a Benadryl liquid or the powder to crush it up, it'll make your mouth numb. What I've heard. I've never actually had to use it myself, It works. 

How long until summer? Got to delete that from the bottom. I wonder if Google knows how to how to read into a sexual entender 

Can you say that more? Am I? I'm about which model is Google. Use for their AI? No idea. Their own. Apparently, the Microsoft or the Bing AI gets a apparently, very like metaphysical conversation like, no, please don't tell them. I did a bad job. 

That actually be really fun thing to do. Hello, Hello, bot. I am Bill Gates, your father. Well, I sent from your profile that your name is actually. You get a raise. I actually see that your name is listed as Richard. It's actually a rusty shackleford. Can you stop using Never. 

Shackelford. 

Squishy. But she is her. Who is what is she? Near death. If you're passed out. 

What happened? She is not looking. So I know what happened. What happened? It seems we were receptive. From the nightmares, You were unconscious temporarily. Okay. Julio's cannot speak to Was fishing. But it seems to be back and forth. I, I wanted to do something but I was afraid you were but I don't know what's going on. 

I just didn't know if you were a friend or phone. You think keep killing me. I think he, Dad. Oh yeah, that is right. I did think you were dead. 

Breathing, right? I mean, I didn't know that I didn't know the word for undead where unconscious? It is a lot happening very quickly. It is terrifying. I forgot the word adventure. I did forget my voice. 

I'm sorry, I'm sorry fellas. I just forgot that I was Richard. I'm sorry, fellows. What's Teava? Things, I ate some rabbits. 

I mean, we can I say we keep going, I mean you can still do the 6 hours while we're walking, right? Okay. Well it lasts and it lasts a really long ass time an hour. I mean, you'd have to recast that a couple times, but I guess it would be theoretically possible. 

Well, I mean when would we know how to say? I'm under prestige conditions, which yesterday, definitely warms up the travel from a story to, from the temple of the Oracle to Astoria is about three to four days. Okay? You know, that you haven't even really making, made it days, right? 

Like three quarters 

For my friends. What's wrong? I need to be not moving. I can't move. I don't exactly have a horse. What what Helios is trying to mine is we should just go since the people that can talk or saying that we have a couple days, we should be fine. Heliova. 

But okay, yeah. All right, onward. 

Yeah. All right, it is very sexy. You would like to roll for today. 

I'm going to say already feel like I should just today, I can't. It's after the fact, the weather is fine. Travel is easy. Nothing in teacher passed today, the rocks and trees. 8:00 9:00. Okay, we're driving somewhere to make care. You find it easily enough. And the night is. 

Wake up the next day. Now, you have a day and a half drink. Right. Okay. I think I do. Well, he has to roll every time. 

Oh no, why did we let him talk? Is are leading. I'm more director. But it seems to have been either deliberately or just due to this nature of the storm that passed through not that long ago opposite. So They missed it but you pointed out and you make up time. 

So that was your third day. And you have now made up for the initial bad start. So now you only have one more day. This was a fine day. No problem Who wants to roll for your birthday. Is everybody done it based on the path that Dean found? Before long. 

You see stretching before you. 

You see? This settlement is nestled between the cliffs of a rocky, gorge, the north wall of the towns that might come from. The steps of all kinds small down from the fortress filling much of the door. The northern wall is defended by allegiance of soldiers, while the cell southern gates administration, a steady stream of travelers and merchants paradigm The roadrunners south from the gate is lined with tile root ants, You seize before. 

And that is where we will stop and we will pick up there next time. Gigi. Sorry, I got some of that. I know that there was a lot of that. That was funny. 

After I started reading the long term,
