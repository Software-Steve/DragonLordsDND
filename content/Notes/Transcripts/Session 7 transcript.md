Thought you left the Amphitheater, the location where you are instructed to reconvene after taking care of your business. How do you In other groups? We palette Balfour and Ira, major way? Looking for a combination of weaponry and supplys. You major way words. Vulcans Hall, supposedly. One of the better Smitty's in a story as gathered by some information that Falco was able to exchange with a traveling merchant.

Entering in you met, hmm. The dwarf smithy who owns the Vulcans Hall. Beltrick metal bless. Being a rather gruff. Unresponsive, You looked at his wares but really quickly determined that their price range was a bit a bit. Leaving there. He went next door to a simple general store which had a variety of things.

Weapons farmers, defensive item means basic spell, work basic potions. Fun there, a number of enchanted bows, which were tested and sampled by Ira and eventually determined to purchase one in exchange for some money and the old hand across them. Making your way out and also soft potential potions for your upcoming competition making the way to a nearby apothecary.

One by a peculiar. No, who seemed to be very excitable and eager to experiment with various things there you Purchased a number of Potion one. I think it was just the inspection. Yeah, I think it was just one and You did your business, however, talent, noticing, one potion that seemed to get catched his attention.

The conversation was had about, it's potential uses and what does it do? The excitable gnome explained that it caused an individual to expire. By dysentery. Stupid. Hey advanced food poisoning. Okay, after an agreement of Testing this potion on various creatures and various sizes of creature and agreeing to bring back notes detailing, the effects that it had, the potion was sold to count and reduce price as the gnome was eagerly excited for what you might return.

In terms of what it did leaving the apothecary, your potions recently purchased, you also make your way towards The amphitheater. And that is where we reconvene both groups have recently made it. About. Here. Well actually, no. We made it here. One group coming from the north. The other group coming from The kind of self-eased.

Reconvening here is where you see each other. School. And that is why we pick up.

How do you do? Fellows. It seems we've got some good information from the library after all. It's good. Should we go somewhere? Primary talk about it. Well, we are close to the end where we were to meet up. Yeah, let's just head over there then, yeah. Like, if I shall kid him as a Because he where you going he throws.

Little bit. You know, lead the way to the end we were to meet it all. All ready. So you start to make your way words the end. Oops.

Yeah, it wasn't sure if I was casting that correctly. Oh, you meant. You meant casting the website. I thought you meant casting a spell of like huh? What? Wait, what's it? What's he You can't say don't? Yeah, don't bother rolling, half damage will still kill you. And you got a little sky.

Don't forget meteor. Just anyway, you start to make your way towards the amphitheater, and you do see a number of signs for various ins. As they all kind of a large section of this place is denoted to ins and places to stay where people can easily pick up the shows at the camp at the editors, you see, a number of them, the grateful traveler, the slumbering, giant tinkers call.

And you do eventually, see a sign for the one that was specified by Kara, the breathless spirit. And as you get close to the doors, you do start to hear.

That's not very bad.

Coming from the amphitheater.

Not where we're going? Well no, you're standing right in front of the the door to the breathless spirit which is kind of this big building. I don't know if you can see it yet. You were pretty much right here at the entrance, but the voice coming from the amphitheater, which is still towards the west is carried.

And you can kind of start to see why people like to stay here. Even if not visibly watching, they can still hear the performances.

Can because here it depends. Do we have? So do they do? We have the time? Just inside doing the rush. But I mean what time of day is it now it was. Oh, it's like mid-afternoon I want to say I don't yeah, it was there's like two when you split up, say each adventure.

Took about mmm. Well actually neither of you, found it a medium. So I'd say the whole thing took about two hours for each group. So the main is to get right there. Oh yeah, it's about okay. Well, I'm suppose we do have a little bit of times since we were going to wait until nightfall.

Share. See the show for a little bit against. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense to me. Thank you, So I don't know. Showing something about what is your favorite kind of music? I mean kind of you cannot have a favorite of, you know,

Except country. Today, what's that? Well then what is what is your favorite to use? And who is your favorite party? Gets the Hey, with theater. It's like a thing. Denver, a wonderful presentation. And now using it from the mountains, we got the hillbilly brother little I'm back. I don't need a scorpion.

Right.

I don't mind checking it out for a little bit. Sometimes ago. Yeah, probably stay out near the top. Yeah. Just For yeah. So I don't get like pay here. Well, as you make your way towards the amphitheater, you get to about here, kind of at the very back and you can see this is the very large empathy, and it is pictures, like, an outdoor stadium.

But actually, even larger than that and you can see that the lines of chairs or benches, the like, the other turn. Yeah. Semi circle, kind of all going down. Just like, you know, our football stadiums, technically baseball sticking, right? Oh yeah, all of them are fit. There are people standing in the aisles.

Clearly people that you can tell probably not supposed to be doing that and there are behind each of like the edges of the of the benches, the furthest back, you can see that there are like bushes and different kinds of plants that people have taught for decoration. Basically and you see that this kind of this entire area leading towards the The seats are just packed with people.

You don't actually like get the full beauty of the amphitheater before you start running into, like, people standing and watching basically rubber

Number of pushed through, no. Yeah, even in this kind of this chaotic. Stop stop, stopping and staring. There is kind of a flow to it. Where people are the the bike standards who are not really taking in the show safe for a while and then kind of start to shift around.

Well other people who got the who's attention was drawn to this performance. Allow them to move forward, eventually, you're able to move to the basically that top of the stairs here and looking down, you can see a very familiar face. Tall, blonde hair, very familiar to use, specifically could be One of the disguises of heart.

She is singing very much in a deep baritone male voice and you actually see that The instruments that are being played for this are all kind of slowly rotating around them. They seem to be playing themselves. There is not a band. Before individuals playing these instruments, they are just slowly rotating around early.

If you see a number of things very strings, you would live could be recognizable.

And, The performance continues if you will stay for another about 15 minutes. I mean we may as well since that's the person we're supposed to mix and she's slowly. It almost looks as though she's conducting the instruments, but it's a very flowing.

It gears listening thinking about how keeping I'm trying to figure it out. Oh, you guys, you mean how he could attend? Yeah, not. Oh yeah. I could too. He's like trying to figure out like, always disposal. That's 35 on her performance check. So it is reaping just that you see, you can see that like the entire cloud, even Well, then you would expect not really to be drawn into such a kind of basic performance like little children, who might be more interested in something that colorate something with a bit more pizzas.

You'd almost say everybody's at the seat of their life at the front of their suits like leaning and intently focus like you can completely see that like an individual who seems to be so focused doesn't even pay attention to the fact that a small carrying store has landed on her head and is just standing.

It doesn't even seem to notice The prominence goes on and then eventually comes to a clubs at which point immediately everybody in the stands up and is applaud, you see people throwing coins throwing flowers knowing various things But as much as I throw my boss might take you kind of I threw his underwear.

Oh yeah he's yeah. Could he just seriously sign my dance. Oh boy. So yeah, and he kind of seen that this is a this is an actually like a plan show. This is kind of and you know this is Coming from here that if there's planned. Performance is that you have a theater is open for anybody to come and perform.

It's like street performances. The money organized and revered sales points and people are continuing to, you know, some people now realizing that just throwing their money is just hitting people further down. People are starting to like get into an organized line to come to the bottom of the theater and basically give their donations to the program and their gifts.

And basically, also go up and greet for performance after because it's a pretty large crowd after about 20 minutes of this, the crowd as finally, like completely dispersed. But some of them are still kind of knowing about how, right? And at that point, Kara starts to kind of gather up.

The various things my meek 30 pounds in China can only be the tyrant cast magnet, right? Yeah. So what would you do with the whole wheel of cheese? Guarantee it. Well, it's almost somebody through a whole wheel of cheese at the water coin. She's probably not in the end times.

Well, the pencil on the coin, but the totally not a gold. There's some places like Make sure you're going together. He's lying. So no he wants his sex signing to be much more intimate. Is over my life a little bit. Oh no, I don't know what kiddeams into not asking.

We don't. You know, I do know and you don't Oh sorry. Like for an hour, I was just telling see if I'm not gonna roll play that with you. That's weird. Which is pretend like, it happened. Well, just for time. So that's for the real. Yeah. We'll do the fade.

Yeah, and take black. Okay. So this have and we fade black again. Steve the curtain and then I hello, Steve's backstory. It's all like blacked out. I think looks like a CI, and they begin to protect it. Some weird 69 with feet, redacted. Yeah, the only thing here anyway, after a little while, and her disguise does come up a rather Large, what looks to be just kind of like a blanket behind her, like, tied, up in.

Kind of like, what you'd expect in those like, hopa old movies. Like a blanket to escape right there. All basically, that's what she's carrying along. She sees the same to you and Kind of shapers really kind of smart. So a little bit we kind of like baseball that walks over one thing.

Wonderful. This ones. Thank you, Billy. Well I've certainly hope so some of that was intended. Know it. Indeed, you're making way into the end and this is a very large.

And once again, this is kind of like a common area. There are a lot of, like, recliners kind of, kind of a common area and also like a intro like And what dining area. There are tables, where people are getting some kind of meals, you gather that there's probably a larger Peace explains somewhere else in the building.

And you do see a number of workers, milling about kind of somebody behind what happened kind of looks like for, like a better time. Like a receptionist. That's Samely. They've got be going through a ledger of some kind.

Well, I have already taken a little bit of giving us a zoom for this evening. One of the larger ones. Thank you. I guess. Feel free to do what you wish. I'm going to take care of some of this and I'll be back. Okay, box off.

It's very large.

Just probably.

It's always worth the shot, though. How many, how many days of the week? Did you get to hang out with your muse? Currently every every day, it's becoming These exercising, too. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't think so. Should be like some food if you just eat. Like, what? Two hours away.

We're just what we're like. We're just waiting for Good night. Yeah, we're just waiting for the night. We just pretty much, I didn't have anything else I needed so I probably just like head to the room and discussed them information. We found hanging out for like an hour downstairs, maybe like just listening to people tell stories and so there's anything interesting to come up and just move go upstairs or whatever that works.

Is that what everybody's going? Just below kind of quick dreams. Yeah, if it's only there, you know, even inquiry you can find out there is a bar. Yeah, so I'm just around see what's happening? Okay, yeah. Simply new invention, somebody calls whiskey. I'll try the new shoot. Yeah, you get a little tip of these small flats questionably testimony.

Okay? And the personal sign, the bar ruin, the son of man, rather Rough individual with kind of that like, far as candle bar mustache. That like, it doesn't stop. Here, don't go down a little bit. He just kind of looks at young goes, kind of a skinny philosophy. We just tell them you want to just Back, not be careful.

It's gonna hit you. Okay? So I can't wait till we help. Sell part two, make constitution, saving throw cadine because you're just taking a shot. It's okay longer than regular whiskey. Three. All right to me. Oh yeah, it burns. Whoa, you can already feel yourself. Starting to get busy.

Small, will impacts a punch. Oh, that's how we make it. Cheese. I probably I probably should have asked this before. I gave that to you. You're a human, right? This was more than concoction, so You might want to hey like grab the glass of like very good. Just don't mistake.

You're going to be okay buddy, but you might want to just now I know I got this far, so I'll pay more much. That it's not much. It's about a copper. Cool. And you are a copper for risk life loss. Like you, you're already like your fingers. You too can get drunk for the low low price of nothing.

Oh, you got a 10? Yeah. You sure a lot of general talk, a lot of, it seems to be merchants talking about various dealings. You hear a lot of conversation about the performance that just happened, right? You do hear a lot of talk about the concerns that the military seems to be in such a state of focus, but also not seeming to do anything like readiness.

Oh, yeah. Readiness without any actual, like actions being taken, right? Which kind of has people at a stated confusion and concern. They're not yet at a alarm, but it's starting to go that way because you you over listening it, you do hear that the military has been in this kind of state of aware alertness for a while, right?

It's not something that just started. It's been there for a while. So people are kind of like This part. When is it just when's the shoot gonna drop? What, when what new right is, this whatever's gonna happen at, right? We can get past whatever's happening, if you don't glean much else from Okay.

All right. What are you doing? It's kind of an hour of chill. Just trying to keep an eye on everyone, trying to separate just like mmm, everyone's okay. If you kind of just keep an eye on 19 19.

Yeah, as different as warranting like I need to pay attention to this except for one ending. To keep the fun of taking scriptures. I have another problem. Okay, here we go. Perfect, case of Okay, so after a little while Iraq, you do see something that does catch your attention, a very large powerfully built man.

Videos and a black hair actually even larger. Physically, speaking than healed, this person's probably pushing about seven foot tall. Very very and he's wearing kind of this long blue kind of it's a nice basic cloak type of deal. It goes over his shoulders. There is a hood that is currently not over but you can tell just by like how big this cloak is that this person is physically powerful built the like a brick house and he stands very casually.

He does seem to give a survey of the room very quick. Yeah, she's security. Doesn't seem to catch, doesn't seem to see anything that seems to put in more aware, okay? And, and then starts to make his way like past. You doesn't seem to know this you really and alcohol with a 19.

You said, yeah, I did a 19 as you passes, you see a bit of the, a bit of the cloak kind of flat by. And you see Thank you for that Chase.

And I love you, too. That was more like total. I'm insulted like an obsidian. Wellington's complaints. The only see a little bit about.

Can continue. Like over obsidian things, depending on making very intentionally. No problem. Just because this is like there quick as a toga 16 thinking about it and in fact, that you've seen a lot of this simple or gathered. Yeah, that was probably the symbolism.

And he's walking up and he was with him, he's walking out the door, you can tell that it's he's kind of he's not necessarily hiding but it's also not drawing it to attention, like a lot of people they just met seem to almost flock the symbol. He's not going to like do everything in his power to make sure it's not like detectable in some manner but it is under the clove.

He just seemed to not be hanging up attention in that, right? He's just Okay, he is walking up. Okay, I'm gonna go. To file for. Like, no, I'm just gonna envision it be a football away. Okay. Now let's go back. So crab

Okay, there was, there's a pretty casual With a seven. Just walk out the door.

So built bigger than people. Scared. I didn't see anything here. There's like, is there any others? I didn't see anything else. You saw his blue cloak black hair. There seemed to be you got a 19 right? Yeah. Oddly and you would have seen this clearly oddly. There seem to be almost a fixed in his hair.

Well, looks to be silver scale. Only like to the left side, like there seemed to be like in his hair, kind of like, Like a hair brace, like, grading and a number of silver scares about five. I assume scales. In this case, meaning like fish, scales are dragon scales For this specifically Ira make a second perception.

Check to see if you can tell what type of scales are 17 17, 17 are, and with your background, being an outsider. You're pretty sure those are dragon skills.

See, which way. No, I didn't see I was overriding you. I just saw him going for the door. I don't know how far away I'm in for Balfour, but I would be like oh probably didn't leave a comment area so you would also be very like There would be like, yeah, you might be like Depending on the path you wanted to take about or you might be like three to five steps away.

Okay? Because he's been kind of like, moving to position kind of sitting listening and other place. Right? Okay, yeah, I would probably point out to him like a nonchalant. I I'd say, Yeah, I'd say she points came out to you about or, and you're able to see the back of this person because he hasn't left yet.

He's so, okay, so west. And yeah, can I cast clairvoyance? And, Pretty good. Okay. So like yo, basically, grab something to nobody sees and then create you only read off what colors? Yes. Please. So you created all sensor within range. So other casting products, nevermind that may not work in that case.

Skating rinks. No no. So it's just you created. Yeah, censor and then you can see here through that and you can place it anywhere within a mile of you Yeah. So put it on like this actually I mean it shouldn't do a history or something. Do I have an idea of where the temple of sea drawing is or have we seen it maybe see history?

We heard about it. Because the people were going there at the very beginning, you would have a rough idea of not a first not an exact location. But you would have a rough idea of where The forces of Cedron, you know, kind of base inside of a story and you would know If I can find it.

Those.

Only know I grow eyebrows, I wrote the minor. And notices. Wait, Steve you ate dinner, right? You did. He's you shouldn't be done. Dissociating, I think is the word I was looking for, so you shouldn't be discussing? There I go. I didn't finish it. My tummy was like where Bum bum bum, okay?

So sorry about that. You wouldn't know that kind of as A. Jab at a pointed insult. You know, that the forces of the cult of syndrome has kind of set up base. In their kind of base in Astoria is in view of python castle, right? Yeah. Uh-huh. You don't know which building it is, but you know that it is very like when you walk out of pythons like Paul, you can see the building that there's and I thought it was a relatively tall one from what we were talking about or something or I'm gonna make that assumption but it's not relatively tall it's it's raised up, I think.

Yep. Okay. Well, what I would like to do If I think that I could see it from high authorities, right? We were there and this is within the mile range, do we think, or how where we think a miles would be from us? You are not in a mile of five orders.

Yeah. That'd be like you like maybe around here. Some more central. Be maybe like a mile. Yeah. If I know it's up there somewhere. That probably be looking like the main thoroughfare. Yeah. Just to see if. Okay. Okay. That was number four like over here. Yes, right. That is that is right.

It's almost easier to stand at times. Oh, yeah, easily, right. Yeah, okay. But yeah. So, you know, If I think I at least can see it from here, then I be trying to go somewhere around here. Give me fall and at least be able to see. Do you have to see the location?

I just have to know. Oh, okay. So let me read the whole thing to you. Yes. So you create an invisible sensitive with them range, one mile? Okay. To a location familiar to you. The ones you have visited or seen before. Okay, or in obvious location it's unfamiliar to.

You doesn't want here since it remains in place for the duration 10 minutes and it can't be attacked or otherwise, interacted with me choose cast, a spell. Choose to you in your hearing and you can see through you know you can use it to sense and see through it more.

You can swap between hearing and seeing. Okay, it's something a creature can see this answer such as true site or see invisibility. They stay aluminous intangible ball in the size of your fists. It doesn't really say like it just like a mile. Yeah. And I presume like you know, hiking such included.

Yeah. Could you just like black this? You guys went to one? Yeah, 99 99 99 was Vulcan's Hall and then they went to these kind of building, right? Immediately beside it, right? I would say because unfortunately there is no measurement lines on this bright spot, okay? Just like I said, I was wildly in Chinese that direct.

What is this a city of and then it's a circle around that. Take a big idea. Yeah. Okay. Because you eat because it's a mile in any direction, right? And like this is about as far as you can get this direction. Yeah, no, that's fine. Yep. Okay. So, yeah.

And then I'll be, I don't think it really says like turning the looking and such and the spell. But yeah, I mean, I assume that you can kind of like just panic to look around and I know you can't move it, right? I'm I'm pretty sure you can just like, look right here.

Yeah, it's not Ashley, but it was pretty like, is it? Yeah, so when you have to choose, which website, yeah, hearing there, well right, but not to see, right? So you guys, I'm like the that does take 10 minutes, the cast. Okay. But I'd like to put it out there so I can see it.

There's only this activity. If I see him walk by okay. Go, maybe looking see if he talks to anybody. Okay, so you start casting. Yeah and you send out your ball of clairvoyance right. And Remembering the road and the buildings. Where would you put it? So, I mean I know how tall the buildings are around there so I'd be trying to probably get like, well, over them.

So I could see down on the roads. Gotcha. But not too far away. So I can't see. Gotcha, got so what I'm thinking is like I assume most of these are like maybe two, sorry, three stories. Some of them, some of them and it is kind of hard to tell.

Some of them are actually, like the building is not on the ground. There's like a wises and the buildings are on. It's like the sort of tier. Yeah, right right. Yes, so for the record though, Vulcans Hall is on. We'll say ground ground. Yeah right. Yeah. So that's why I'd be trying to do somewhere that middle range.

I could still distinguish them. Yeah. Or other people but at least like up above a bit right to release trying to get a semi aerial view but not so far. Okay chase just tell him you're flying through drone. So you start casting your spelling ten minutes go by and you immediately can see kind of almost looking down.

Immediately to your left, you can see Vulcans Hall, you can see the Apothecary and the General Store that you saw. You see, people milling about right? How long does this spell? Ask 10 minutes a minute? So casting television, 10 minutes and then 10 minutes. So about Actually, let's just see.

Yeah, he's not hurt. So he gets out he just did actually not and based on the business that hemorrhoids doing I'd say about. You cut, you still managed to cut clothes about a minute and a half. Later, you do see the fronts within my casting as a, you casted, 10 minutes and then and then like a minute and a half late, right?

So you're still pretty close. You do see a face of this thing. You did welcome. I would say. Actually, that's pretty well. Emily and Chase for me because both of you saw the face of this person. Like I guess he isn't a big guy so, I bet you good last time I try to do it tomorrow, okay.

I'm like Also, ignore the fact that the name was also written in another location that I didn't pay attention to. Didn't pay attention to that. Anyway, you see him and he's walking and you do see what looks to be another of other about four. Their retire is much more familiar to you.

You've seen these are kind of the generic traveling cultists quotes, right? Right for individuals who look incredibly small standing next to this man, right? Even from how far up even from how far up you are they look Right? And they do walk and they actually get to Yeah, they actually get about.

To where you are. All right so you see as the they all start to walk underneath like they're walking towards they walk underneath your orb and so no it's like okay yeah. And your main target stops in front of the door of I don't have forget the name. Focus.

Okay, Walkins home. He stops in front and you watch as he walks in. Okay. About three minutes later he comes back, okay holding? What looks like a very lore. Very beautiful sword and he's holding. Okay. Do you like an investigation? Let's see if I see anything that sticks out from the sword, just my eyesight.

Yeah, make a an investigation. Check At the 16 16 from your And I am sorry. Yeah I would say roll with advantage based on your history. Okay. What do we see what it is? You just like in global. Are you like? Yeah you like I mean I would say yes I'm kind of trying to be okay you know nonchalant about this and you probably still love me.

It's really close enough to you. Hear me start doing some things for it. So for the rest of you you probably want to be seeing me doing anything. Yeah. Don't want people to I'll be trying to awesome if you like I help you or something. Yes. So I think the only way that different is like if he's using one of the senses in the orb, he can't use But you can just be like staring.

Yeah, I don't think Claire Williams works that way, but I don't really the other, but there's other To do Well, the other spells usually state. It's explicitly that you can perceive through your normal sense. Yes. That's like the elder. There's a couple of maybe night I guess I would picture.

It is like I mean something's on your left ear? Yeah. I mean, he's he's probably not like fully cognizant of this aroundings, right? Yeah. I assume you can like switch focus back and yeah. Right. Focus on. Okay, protect Yeah, so like probably not me like focused on anyone finger another, but I've also trying to listen all the conversations.

Justually yeah. So it wasn't trying to be like Yeah. I I'd say well I wrote there and basically it looked to any observer. It looks like the two of your talking right right turn right. That's why the second was 13 to 16 stolen yeah you can tell this is a very very well made sort on it's a little hard to tell but you think that this wasn't something that was made new if anything?

It looks like this was more of a touchup or repair, right? It wasn't specifically forged here. You're not a hundred percent sure of that. It's just from like the general look of like a brand new just been made sword versus something. That's been. We also installed the stuff on the wall.

Yeah. You that's good point. You do not recognize this as a sword that was on. Okay. On and you can see, he kind of seems to take. It seems to inspect it a little bit. Once his thumb up along the blade which instantly like he puts it there and it already starts bleeding, right?

And he's still runs his thumb all the way up. Yeah. Since the inspector you, there's actually a line of red all the way up. It. Mm-hmm seems to be please by it in the see kind of a yeah, a little like an appreciative smart. Right? Kind of starts to love the cut.

Swings the sword, the blood flings to the ground. You can see that one of the other cultists seems to be talking to him kind of a little bit more animated. Yeah seeming basically looking like someone that's like Right on. Come on. What are you doing? Come right. I I know who you are.

But come on. Like even you you're still late. Yeah, and the man very large man, just kind of looks over and like Puts two fingers, like underneath the person's legs, basically, like, under their chin and then like starts to actually lift them off the ground. Yeah, not very far.

Just enough just now, you can see that. The other person immediately starts to panic and you just like, puts them down the beginning as far as you can tell. He looks you just a very like, freakishly large. Put some down. And just kind of like for a few seconds just like stamp face.

Just, Then he moves up and the other four immediately starts to follow you, You watch and you watch and you have a pretty clear sight because you've noticed as this troop before has been coming and going the crowd in this area. Oh, right. Right. Like, I'm immediately dispersed, right?

So you actually have a pretty clear line of sight as you watch them. Walk to this point, Okay? And you watch two things happen, Yeah, you watch Two things happen. You watch the four immediately. Take off this direction. Uh-huh. You watch the big man.

Oh yeah, you watch the big man? Just like kind of put the sword on his back. Okay. It this would be from behind. Yeah. Yeah. Right seem to stretch a little bit. And then you watch his heat like just leaps, like grabs the roof, and this is a big ass, you know, because because that's then the side of the mountains.

Yeah, yeah. So it's up, right? So this this is like a good like 20, 30 foot jump, perhaps the roof, just pulls him up, walks on the roof and then he disappears on the other side. Like, he walks like around the that? Yeah, he like grabs up here. Walks straight, walks straight.

And then like you watches, he basically just falls off and he's out of here. Okay, got it. So I think that's probably right at the max time of mine. We're probably pushing about eight, nine minutes. So I think like, the last thing I went to look at is Do I feel like a door on the side that he junk up, just see if he didn't use it.

Oh, make a perception check. To see if you can see, if there's a little 19, you do not see a door that just appears to be the back of the building. Okay, there do appear to be. It's kind of hard to tell, but there might be a couple of windows or right?

But the ones. Yeah, there doesn't seem to be anything like a door, okay? Because that's actually like for like a better term. That looks like mountain wall and then the house starts with a building starts, right? Kind of perfect. Yeah, it's not right. Okay yeah. All right at that point your spell fades.

Yeah. Come out of it before that top Mary, what are you doing for this hour break? I'm gonna go check out the room and and just go see how it's kind of safe. It is for us to talk about stuff. Okay, we'll come back to you in the morning.

What are you doing during the hour break? I'm probably sticking with kidney making sure he doesn't get in any trouble. Okay? For a while because he's pretty yeah, okay, world. So, we'll come to America. We're not detailed. He's like upstairs after some required. Yeah, you get the room. Matt, I also wanted to live.

Okay. So the both of you. Yeah, I very good comic makes him inquiries figure out what room rented. Surprisingly, under her very poorly. Fake name of era? Yeah, it's not okay. And you come up, you find the room. You do not on the door. You just walk it. It's our room.

I'm just walking in. Okay, you just walk in and you see fires there, naked, just sitting down on the ground. You got to go through the room tire, like, sled of all the donations, like, this, sorting everything into positives and you see a very large pile of copper, a very large pile of silver, and a respectable pile of gold.

But you also do see life that viles, a little glass, vials of things of flowers in like bouquets and stuff like that. And she's just kind of

Well come on just the room speaking up and this is like you know kind of like the fancy like sweet hotel things that's like it's practically like a little girl. It's kind of like the pencils and you should file. You mean like an open television or like one that you actually put a potion.

It looks like a lot of them seem to be some kind of like perfume bottles. They're like small glass with kind of like oh my like a squeeze top Some kind of thing, I don't know that, Don't do it. I mean, I wasn't planning to. I had a different intention for asking that.

So it looks like a disadvantage. She looks like she's sorted out. There are appear to be warm. All right, I just take a look. They're appear to be about five vials like that, that seemed to be perfume of some kind and there are two vials of a very familiar looking red liquid.

Feeling and she's got like all the all the money sorted out and she seems to be like You know, kind of like thinking calculating, right? It's ugly. Okay. That's not a bad guy, Paul. That always sounds terrible to say about that. But I suppose, Now, you all will have more funds.

We need to take these. Perfumes and sell them. It's very nice. Very, very nice for people, to donate, these kind of things, unfortunately, for my endeavors, my, for our endeavors. Fancy smelling. Perfumes or not exactly the most. Helpful. Oh kidding girl. Yeah. Well that goes over when you send me.

Oh, I hate to screw it on.

Is a professional script. If it's something you like it, there's no reason you can't keep us. We don't it's not like we're in dire need of anything. Right at the moment. Hearts. So, what do you think about the room? Think we could continue our discussion here. All I think with a little bit of Preparation will probably suit us just by Very well done.

Hopefully there's a bathroom around here somewhere. She just pointed you just do that right in front of her you say yeah bad you. Yeah this robe as I go to the bathroom. So I'm pulling up pieces of clothing. As she walked by, she definitely here because he turned away you just here.

Oh my sorry. You're a woman screamed. What about huge? Yeah, yes, that was the reason so when in grace Make sure that you want the attention. Is an attendant I have which is like, do you respond? Yeah, I mean well, they had she was cleaning my first came in so you might want to I was like, never mind.

I'm sure it was you government. I'm not picking those clothes up. No, they had I don't refill it. It's like but the point of this spirit just Are you doing anything? I guess I'll just. I'm glad you got some health potions that we can find in the in town.

Well, just somebody don't know. Where did you go? We went to the blacksmith and then the apothecary. The one just down the road. The one run by the fun little mountain. Yes. Fun. Oh okay yeah, that's something for them. Wrong with some notes. Notes. Before we get to that.

Before we get to any of that, that's all very concerned. If you probably take these And she hands you the two minor health potions. Protections. Enough. What did you buy a poison? Potion That sounds about right. Do you? That's a little show. That's why I promised him notes. Okay, did he tell you what it does and what he thinks it does.

Just spices. Potion of healing. Yeah. Two minus. I can't find what? Yeah, it's the regular heel. Yeah. That's the smallest denomination. There is Ment. Okay. Where were we? What those are brushes. Did he made the potion? No. That was answered. Did he tell? Did he tell you what? It does.

Yes, we also tested all my low friend and a magical beast of about vegetable summit based. I think it was neither of which were effective. Haha. All right. Well, As I have seen some of his work do be careful. I don't know if he told you this but some of his concoctions are volatile.

I mean yeah, I wouldn't agree with that but I'm just perfect person, I handled this one. Okay, let me rephrase that but you probably shouldn't put it near flame. She meant actually. I figured just to be on the same side, I know that. A previous concoction of his was not intended to explode but did so just success handle it.

Careful, our call, he was covered in soap. When we met him first time, I wouldn't be surprised by that. I hope that that's all that. That's all I color was. Huh. A couple seconds later you do here. Or looks to be like a very young man comes running out, like ice, like kind of covered like slightly blushing as she runs out.

Just here ago. I shouldn't have done that, but that was entertaining. She'll get a bonus. Let's just help the water's cold. I think they try very hard to make sure that they keep it at a nice pleasant warm temperature. Which I think you can adjust as, as you desire.

So that is a remind me to tell everybody and distribute this. I managed to make about roughly 200 gold. Once we convert everything of Okay, don't let me forget. And if you excuse me, I'm going to start making this room a bit more. Product and you watch this, you start to go to life the doors and windows and she starts motioning.

Basically chance of shiming an arcade? Yeah, so Coming back to you too, from both. We're here everybody. I'm dressed. I got out of that conversation without telling her what actually does, right? She know she's a little welcome to them. Okay. Yeah you find helios and codeine Kadeem. Still pretty buzzed trying to get more today.

I don't think that would be wise so good. Yes, but one of them almost not you on your ass. I had to catch you. Let's go upstairs for a bit. Okay, Anderson Corral. I'm upstairs, right? You make the way upstairs. Since kind of all of those things happen, how long would your be married?

Because all of these things were happening simultaneously. It depends on the water is, but probably like, 30, 40 minutes once you get in, you can tell that it is completely magically adjustable. That's gonna be like 45 minutes. All right. So it's very common. Yeah. You all get up after about an hour and you can see that Cara is like in front of like a last section of wall and you can see well actually you can because she doesn't walked in But you come to the door, right?

C is cool It. You haven't watched it yet. The door is currently closed off in the hallway. No, there's civil law and you hear one moment. Almost finished. Shop the door, living boarding up part. Car is standing in front of you once again, looking at she normally does okay.

Yeah. To me and as you walk in the first thing, you all see as you walk in is marriage clothes on the ground, exactly where they got in the top right? No, because that's a ways on like this are very big like we'll be ready to have solid inning.

Okay. The other thing you see is that like you can tell that there's some kind of like it's powerful enough to be basically visible all like all around the small languages. All around the ceiling and all around the world. Okay, boy, Just a precaution, right? Well now that we're almost all back together.

It's at this point in time, Eric you're coming out of the wash area in just a towel on the ceiling, okay? So Mary comes out in just a towel and on the way back on Magically picking up my clothes Mayhem. Just yep. So you don't walk back into the so the sitting room where everybody is that's where the trail flows was then.

Yes, okay, so you all see marriage walk in in a towel How do you trans? I'm glad we're seeing less than that, we're made. Oh, are you wearing clothes? Yes. Or just walks over my pills on the armor that he's wearing. Does armor counts as close. Especially is just looks at you.

Well I should hope so watching you can't see my bear's chest, I'm wearing armor. Yeah, but do you not have a shirt under that? Well, no. Winter armor, get sticky and hot and smelly. No. No, I feel like, well, maybe if you sweat a lot. Do you not know do you?

That's why I told all the time. Huh. I think it's the big clothes. If you And pretty breezy. And this literally changes I'm talking about the fucking chainmail. I was like, I'm not walking around on a fucking skirt with nothing underneath me. When you might be, I don't know.

I'm not. I, you're short enough. You might. I'm not watching. Oh, why? Because I'm about this. I don't want none of you today. I'm a ditch that's not really has to wear under or else, it will be dragging. Oh boy. Why Oh, he's got a third leg. I mean, you know what they say about the grades?

I don't know. I have no problem. No more. No. What are they say about the grease? And anyway, oh boy, and I'm also pressed into stationing my clothes clean. As I welcome Because I want to feel amazing playing. Well right, I'm gonna make them sound like they said, this unass question has been answered by Mary but there is a washroom.

Should anybody want to take advantage? No, perhaps after tonight's deeds, I need it done. What you? I'm sure you're wear it off by tonight. It's why I didn't let you get any more right here. Yeah. So now the world expect together, I think I'll bring up the iron notice culture.

Of zero or yeah, associated associated with big. So he was alienated in the commentary though. Thinking watch right, large first, yeah, large seven foot tall, black hair, bigger like buffier than helios. So scary. Yeah and he had silver five, silver skills, kind of radiant his hair which was bridge.

And then since I saw this face, could I do a solid image of that for everyone to see it and see what he looked like? So yeah. You want to show that. You want me describe it? I think I'll see the picture since there is a picture to show and it's found in it so yeah.

All right yeah it's on them. It's just so much better.

Yeah. Yeah, it's easy here. Well I think my dogs everything and yeah it's easy for everybody to come to me while I try and hide. Sorry. It's just easier to like hike things. I'm carrying this with, I don't move. Oh okay, we all yeah, I'm going into this world.

Yeah, dollar is creating the silent image for the right? All right. Sorry. What happened? I don't know how to say, sorry. You know something? Yeah, I'm not surprised but older guys Again. Yeah. Yeah, I am. So he may not put four of other alcoholic sheetrock standard and they went to Vulcan sports and looked like he picked up.

For a large, very large floor. From him. The might have been repaired that. We didn't see it when we were in there, and he might have been late for something or meeting with someone. And then he went up to another part and Went to study from the other side.

Of, you know. We're just. Yes. So One of the blessings parts benefits from the fates. I get a few spells, not available and I can see things at distance so degree. Or. But, Whatever the street. Stuff. It's not like that. Yeah, I thought well stay watch. Oh, we'll get to that later.

I assume that I after seeing it. I have no idea who this man is making No, making your picture. Eight. Not you do not recognize this man. Figured out wouldn't, but guess it's worth asking me. Could you make it history? Whoa. Distribution was no need at 30.

You recognize this figure. You recognize him because He always makes his presence known when he visits Mistios. No, I just met Trump Mitchell so hard. No you know, the feet is higher off in the cult of syndrome but you can't think of his name. And you can't think of how high up he is.

You just know that he is an important figure. And that he is powerful. Because he like being from one of the most prominent cities, even in the city like Metros, that still has the cold in it. A lot of the lower members kind of skulk around almost like thieves but he does were other members of the call kind of like dash and do their work at night.

You know, that he walks through the street like without a fear in the world. Okay I will I guess as soon as you do the sales image then I will say I Is somewhat of a comment though, or something. Cultural syndrome. I've seen in many times. I don't know those people.

See it's pretty important thing cities as well. What that swords for?

Well, I have some ideas and I don't like any of them. Grade. Troubling news. Yeah, so safety is recognized us. We stand out pretty well pretty well. Now, Where we have, we have to could make our business more difficult, right? Man. To continue to try to interfere with our Because no way you would know well about the basilisks know, but right.

With pretty, whether he would feel the need to be at the sacrifice. That could be a problem. It's pretty good chance. Know someone you're about. Mmm. On that note marker could deem the want to share, what you learned from the library. Absolutely. We found some very good things, didn't we can do.

Why don't you explain to them what you thought? Oh, but it was you that found. It wasn't it? I don't know the show. I thought that was on the fruitful as we were hoping. Well, I have let me pull out my notes here. Back in my spellbook. Your post on orbit.

Yeah there. Yeah. Now once they were all clean they're kind of long walks over so what

We you see we found this book talks about the mythical creatures in the realm oh boy and it says here that we do need to be someone careful because the scholars that wrote this book and felt it felted a note, worthy inclusion. That they believed that the gaze of this creature turns people into stone.

We also know that the they're not particularly perceptive creatures so some sort of stealth might be a good option. They do dwell in caves so if we if we go in the night or early morning, we might be able to catch them there rather than in the water.

See. And lastly, They usually group together and numbers, less than 10.

Yeah, around usually around three or so. Think about their skin. Not that. I remember that's all I have here in my notes which is literally what I have in my notes. My notes also contain the work done, Just the bullet point with the word gone. Because the next note is helios gets lost in the books.

Here, did get lost in the soul. You. So there's likely they'll be in the cave because well it depends on what time of the day. It seems like they they do love the water so they'll probably be around the rock. Presumably they sleep at night like right. So they'll be in the cave near the Model, we should be able to find them.

All right? Good to know. No, nothing. That's for the book mentioned but definitely a vertex gaze Oh, this way to become a wisdom. Cool. Plan of like, I don't know, throw like a Parts on their heads or something. So we cover their eyes. What it? You know? What? If well you had a good idea at the library?

That's idea. That's my tour. The hotel probably has a mirror. You can borrow, I've been coordinated a mirror that large maybe can speak. You was, this is like a hand like well, yeah, I know. I know I was, I was talking to Mary excited saying to get one from that hotel like, yeah, because we're just gonna walk around with a fucking dressing there, like today.

What are you saying? You're not afraid. I'm the second will be pretty conspicuous. Yes, we're trying to do this secretly. Yeah. You saying it's too heavy for you? No, that's not what I'm saying. So find a mirror, I can't pick up America. Yeah. Yes. Here is the opportunity here would Protecting from their gaze.

No, there wasn't much known about it. The book, just the books, authors just said, that's what they think happened in our climate or something about. Misspelled might redact me some things like that or something like that. Making our comment. Yeah. That's not one idea. Yeah, ma'am. Never had to deal with that before.

Regardless, I have much more limited ways of fighting distance fighting is not really what I do. So I'm welcome. I have to as long as you can stay to its backside. No invert my gaze. It's Not something done particularly often or well. But well perhaps it'd be good to go at night then when they're sleeping.

Yeah, the idea was to go at night. Yes. So how about now then Isn't like five o'clock. Yeah, it's like, yeah. But how long does it take to get there? It's it's, it's like well, right? Yeah, it's crazy. Well, it's slightly off the bottom of the max here. You good also Rocks.

Our pretends to be are going north. Or fight this entire performance, south in the middle of the day. You may build a strange because why we didn't save even leaving. There might be other things down southworth visited. Well, For movements As long as we're not carrying a mirror unless you think of something completely just Like be a reason to go down there.

So we well, I'm thinking of that actually. And with the way that the guards have been checking people in and out at the gates, Mean, you may want to come up with a reason for what we're going south in the middle of the night. Or. And I suppose there may be something we can do in the way of Bribery, perhaps, it's not something that well, many of the guards are known for.

But surely you have a good idea of what to do, what to tell them, seems like you have some sway with these people. You say, well, let's what what I mean, perhaps. If I tell them, we're leaving one an important air in that is to be Kept quiet little coin, perhaps mad wait to

True, my reputation. The other side going first, just distributes and she told me it were not let her forget. It's just laying between all of us trial and right from my living funds, this step to new there are 200 gold. For each of us.

This was from your performance. Yes, before we meet us, I believe feel better. This is another way that I can help us. Yeah, there's only so much directly I can do, but currently this is something that the fates still allow me to do. So, This needs to be good to use.

All right. Well, Is there anything any notable cities or something? South again, them if we want to leave At night. It would just be an odd time to leave for. Travel is kind of what I was getting at. Well, why not leave now and then just wait outside the city gates perhaps right in the much less suspicious that way.

Perhaps, well, that's the right thing. Where are we going before? I'm thinking, where we going to find the best? They must certainly they have to be, they have to be near the rock. Yeah, if they live in caves we search the cave, see search and see if we can find any caves near the waters.

What it sounds like. Right. You know, if we suppose, if we want to leave now and just wait out side the city until night fall It wouldn't be a stretch to say that. I'm just showing you all this surrounding areas, since most of you have never been here before.

It is much safer to visit the area surrounding the city to the south than the north. Okay.

Shall we go then? My love. She was a good time. Well then. I will meet you there. At the rock. Come nightfall and stone because I'm going to attempt a little ploy to try and make people see you all. Still here. You need to catch my meal. You need, right?

And we watch as she kind of like sparks a little bit and like as she like puts her hand in front of her even immediately, she looks like hybrid. So, just a little diversion. So each and every one of you is still seeing within the city. And after you've left good little while.

So you come back from wherever you move, this thing, and you're still here. Should anybody?

Then. I will meet you at the rock.

After dark. So About 9. That works and it's bulldog. Well. Till that. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you right? Yeah. Whatever amount of the money yeah. Yeah because I understand this is just a are we just probably doing just great gold or we want to separate out until the actually look down originally?

What was copper silver? And gold is now gold. Okay got it. Okay, that's not good. You're going to take, you know. Okay. It's very yeah. Yeah, we go. Oh yeah. Well, I mean I cannot I cannot do it. Right, right. I cannot like, no. No, no. Or I head on out.

Yeah, that's what we've everybody to make perception. Check this, you leave.

16\. I'm not you. It's like six, six, 15, 15. Are also. 15, 15. God. Guys. Hey this will be fast. Don't worry. Oh boy, I'm not thinking of away forever man when she's not nothing like

See that for? I am not ready. I'm totally not trying to eat you. She whispers, essentially, as she licks your cheeks, I just come back in here. Licks your cheek. All right, first one. In the oven on each side salty, sweet. I've been like that. I apologize. I regret.

Yeah. As with most things, can I do that now? Your memories mechanically. You can't. You can't erase it. It's just and he just wipes. A magnet. What's a magnet? Capacity fall play. All right. Well I'm gonna I'm gonna lose a memory of meeting you guys but it's worth it takes not the hard drive of a reason memory.

Now just smashes smashes at a couple times. What does this potion do like oh hey I think I have an invisibility potion here. Married drink this and disability for. Okay great. So no amount of magic can clean. This, what you doing? I heading out the south gate. Yeah I think as we go along.

I think I'll probably be up with Gilia's like asking like specific type questions. So people look over here like so what's like this over here or you know, is this something? No kind of thing. This is that brainstorming kind of forced me questions and kind of like comparing it to like, okay, so that was that Yeah, maybe I was listening to you.

Yeah.

Okay. 21, 21. All right.

And then all right. Yep. All right. Mmm, that's what actually Hmm, that's on professional.

If I cut off from vinyl fantasy,

Actually, yeah, don't finish good. Do the other side. Thank you. Okay, and you continually make your way soft words towards the Should we technically self aiming shooting it I'll probably be towards the back and just have observed she okay what? Nothing really transpires too much is you make it wake towards the south gate.

There are garbage once again in the gate. It's starting to get a little later. It's about five thirty six, at this point five time. Ship. Right 5:36. That's a like, down to the minute. I didn't even understand that It was like, well, I know what you meant. I'm just making ahead.

So yeah, it was sugar like synchronized watches Thank you very sundials. So, you are all dark. Before father south on the road here. Okay, so one does actually call out to you, it seems to be. So yes, looks to be younger. You, of course, buy your estimate. What's to be about like just enlisted, like 18 7, right?

Maybe even line about it. Maybe 60 30. Yeah but runs up and you hear very audibly. The very much older looks to be about like 50 seconds. Other government. He doesn't have a sphere but has like we'll see the walls that were played 30. Yeah. Head down. You very audibly.

Just here. Go Oh boy. But the youngster runs up to you and basically holds out the spear that he's holding. Looks like it's been the brand spanking. New like never seen battle before good. It hasn't even been used on an app. Wow, you are. You are helios correct. I am indeed and you are doing me.

The honor of signing my speech. Beautiful. How could I deny such an earnest earthquake? Yeah, I mean, I I assumed it's a wooden half. Yeah, so yeah, I guess I assume that the normal procedure for this is just like, take a diag previously. Take out my fucking shorty. Yeah.

Yeah. Just you've done things like this right quick. Little carving into it. Maybe it's bad. He runs back and you just hear. Youngsters. We're gonna since I'm next to Helios, but you can show a couple of specific problems, okay? Something if you wanted with you Oh boy. Wait no like fighting so yeah.

No, no I knew what you meant. It's always somebody talking. Like wait, I didn't like that chocolate. Together perhaps another time but if you want to see the sunset we should go now fair. I just was a absolutely like the gator just before we get there. Okay. Look around to see if I see any cultists subsidized or the guy.

Thank you, very just one in the nearby alley. It's like just fucking mad dog, you know that you see yeah they have people are going about their business and there are people entering still that you don't see anything.

Move this thing. You wanted to go along south along the road for a little bit. Just I don't know, find a little riser, something to be gonna watch the sunset from so that they can't tell us we're lying. So, make the way over here. Yeah, sure. That looks like yeah, the front step on the top.

Yeah. Just a nice point where you like. Yeah. And this is a lot of people like to come. Watch this. Yeah. Where are you going with that statement? I'm just making an offeration. Yeah, you also got a metal man, you playing so. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh, back into the city.

Oh well, we're on the cliff. I want someone to pick it. Is how it is clothing. So you are out on the left side and you have the next three hours? Is there anything anybody would like to eat? I hope first of all from if you're up here. A little farther away like you'd have to walk back down and around back this way up a half.

So those are some pretty high left, then it's pretty hot. It fits. It's not a jumpable thing, say, I'll just, throw rocks to telescoping stones. That's a lot of it. Oh yeah. What's supposed to thunderstorm tonight? Yeah, I don't need to make anything of it, but I'm not gonna sit with the Google home light.

I do want to get some point. Just go off by myself for a little while and I suppose it would be a bit weird for Haleyos because he wants to go pray. This is the first time he technically knows that he's praying to his father, which is a bit weird, but he would just like to spend a little while praying, you know, for this success of all of this.

There wasn't anything specific I wanted to do with it. Just I will say it takes some time. And after after a little while, You do feel like I have on your back and you do here. My father. And I assume at this point is when Congress shows up, Okay.

Got you. Invite that. You do. It was the boy her voice. Yeah, that's fine. They it's something he probably always did before going to fight in the Colosseum, so it's a habit that he has Yes, I was here. Yeah, a little bit weird now but I'm just gonna sit there like, slogans from other loose so I know what I like to ask.

So we're kind of overlooking the river. Is that right? Yeah, I I imagine since you made this statement about seeing the sunset kind of positioned yourself. Oh, my goodness. Okay, so I'd like to do the clear voice again but I'm like to. So I know right? I'm not familiar with the rock of escort.

Like I'm gonna I didn't see myself. Well, you can see it from. Oh yeah, we are actually very close. So see in that case I don't know who want to call the mile again, but I'd like to do the clear voice. Again, and see if I could scope out where Some of the things are I'd say, the mile would probably put it.

Was pretty pretty. Oh yeah, I take probably just about three. What is? Because I've imagined like if the a mile has been, right? Probably be able to still put like your clitoris, a bottle of them all and wouldn't like see that's material right? You know, it seems like so the questions.

Yeah, probably used anything like yeah, this down here. Okay. But yeah. You like, yeah, because of accurately. The difference. Maybe I could put it down, ground level. But, so, down around here, whatever road they made, you can bring your positions. I don't know this, right? So, actually might be easier if I just, I made up come over.

I mean, how they probably? Yeah. Miles too. We can definitely see. Like, all of we just, as the imperialism was created, we just described how many feet? Yeah. Well somewhere down. Actually maybe they didn't wear anything. Because me lace and lightness and family different from a mile. That's it.

Might not right, yeah? Right. You can put it for about this probably is leagues. I Near home near the water because it sounds more than it's out. Right, right. Okay, so yeah. So can I do like some of the best vacations to see? Yeah, what I see there. Okay, make a perception.

Check to see if you see any pepper. It's in that 20. That's so needed. Yeah, I will say I will say with an at 20 first off, you see? No, caves, okay, around here, they used foot. Well, what you do? See it's technically are different than let me just well give me facts a little bit, but it's basically the same thing.

Yeah, throughout this carbon because it'd be helpful. That's all right. I had an idea of what they look like, but I need to pull it back up. So I might be saying something relatively all without a recall and divided them into inches too, okay? There's like what's five days ago so you wouldn't see me.

Do I said they divided them in the inches. I didn't say anything about finally. Yeah, they did use their miles. They so it was easily right. You do see larger, they're old. So it's they're interesting just like whether and finally from the nearby river, right? Has eroded some of them, but within that 20 you do see what looked to be like lately, defaint and lost in order for single units heading this.

Direct like around the edge. So 20,000 leagues. It's like we're still heading this direction but that's where you? Yeah. You know, pretty sure we can really maybe three miles or is it for us? It's either three or four miles. I think it's three or one kilometer. Okay, I will alert everyone when we started a milestone like, hey, you seeing something?

Yeah, one kilometer is 16 miles. Oh yeah, I haven't thrown. I have the other way around. I mean also I can get yeah. Yeah. Because once I cast that then on Friday? Yeah, so yeah, I'll explain that. Like well two miles. And yeah, yeah, I don't think caves. But I did see the footprints that look like it came down, the zipper.

The one, the rock. Here yet, just say so, Just, So it might have to Right? Going up the rock along the rock tonight. Stuff away. Could be difficult, but that's what we're here for, isn't it?

Yeah, maybe hike. For people who can't see the door, just yeah, yeah. I walk in the middle of the line. So that way I can't. You know.

What half of us? They can't see in the door. Oh I think no. Oh yeah, halflings cannot until I can you can have health can. I don't remember if calic has something or not, but what you have to spell, right? Yeah. I have to spell but it's not prepared, you know, say right.

But yeah, you would have to cast that otherwise you don't either. So yeah, it's normally only half of us. Have. I think we should avoid, you know? Yes, obviously one of avoid me, right? For your first three to three and four carry. Yes, we have carry me. Yeah, one pretty sure right here.

It could be And I think Yahoo sure my career capacity is one condemning. Not the strongest ball here, but it's 195 pounds of push, drag or lifting. Well, escape, I don't know what that means. Name. Long was your life less 150,000 halfway? That'd be a very. I am not me and Alma here.

Does not weigh that much. I would I'll take being carried. I'm not above that. In fact, I'm statistically below it because it's lower than I am or you're tired. You're tall enough. I'm assuming shoulders. Yes. Yeah that's that's yeah, that's higher than I normally am. All of that. He's like, I can't wait to grow up, it might be going over rocks.

So so good. Yeah. All right. The anything else? Negative think I'm just gonna potentially rest for it out so I get responsible. All right. Yeah, a little bit before dark. I'll just wait until it's back. What are you? Well I'm learning more than that but then how do you have a divination spell?

It's what everyone. Oh yeah you might have been in the other room or something. He did explain that earlier. Okay. You just have a face. Are we long rested since we hear? The no, we took a we took today. Yeah because we we met his dad. We slept that was it, that was in the morning and then we spent like around midday with the elaborate rooms of going north.

There, we ran our air and well, we met and talked about the new plan. After I had gone back to talk to a Nora. We talked about that, we ran our errands, went to the end. Now, we're out here. So yeah, we have not long rested since meeting playthough.

We're this morning. Yeah. All in all, this will be a very busy day. Yeah. Oh your choice. Well yeah. I mean they had seven days to do it. Yeah I guess what we're seeing now also. Just keep watching that guy make hey well the same shows Password, Make it perception.

Check If nothing else. Nobody else wants to do anything. Then we're going to be fast, forwarding. I'll be caring. So do you want me? And it doesn't matter. Might be easier for me because I don't have the rocks. What is this? I don't want this. Yeah. It's about 8 o'clock.

Okay, good. And when Very visible. Because he is making absolutely no attempt to be stealthy at all. You actually hear him. Mmm very heavy footballs towards us. No problem or on. Yes sorry this path. Oh and you look over and you do see him it's harder to see but it's still a very vibrant blue clothing.

He's And you can see that behind him.

Zip behind him very tentatively, and not tentatively at all. Find the guards at the set from the south gate. The youngster is very intensively following. Yeah. Like spear at the ready but you can tell that he is shaking and standing next to him. Not looking particularly perturbed. The older daughter.

They're not right the side, this unknown figure. They're kind of like 20 feet away but they are like following He's not being coached, he's not the unknown strangers. Not being stealthy at all. Neither of the dogs you gather that he at the very least, this unknown person knows the back.

Mom, as you watch, you watch us. He makes his way all the way toward to the wrong. Like makes his way out the guards. Stop right about here, like at the edge and he watches the man. Actually the unknown man walks out and like starts climbing up just bear hand, climbing up the wall.

We just yeah, no problem. Hmm rolls of natural ones, slips and falls breaks his back. Love convenience. White mark, man. What are your what are you? That wouldn't matter By the time, you know, whatever is that Well, actually a five could, only improve your rules. What my allies Are.

You guys? No, I'm not doing anything. Yeah, I have to do it before year olds. Okay. So I was just level. It's after we were, oh, after we rolls but before I know the result. Yeah. Well you don't have the result now, I'm not gonna change it. I'm gonna save it for the best of those.

Okay, Although things change that recently or some more recently. Do you know, when they've changed Like his top level, the top level divination thing, I don't know. It's 8 o'clock around because it what it used to be. The top level skill was You got to do it after the role was called.

And change it anyway. But the big, the one I just checked it. It was a you get three important dice as the max level, I mean if you yeah well yeah, I think that that's been that way. Okay, maybe I'm remembering an older edition. We have more like yeah.

And you have two. Nice deeper 14. Whatever you get a thing. Yeah, you're in that. I think it's been that way. Oh so we're like right? Yeah you can see him. It's harder now because it's dark and maybe you probably can't see Actually you spot him point them out.

Yeah. And then you lose him once he gets to like the. Okay, so realistically because it's 8 o'clock question. Yes, I'd be doing a quick and kind of start another clairvoyant to try and listen. So you know, listen to them. I mean you can do it. I mean, he's at the top, right?

You don't know how long he's gonna be there, right? Yeah. So I know it's gonna take 10 minutes to make it. Yeah, you know, but I figured, you know, I might be worth it, just to see if I can hear anything. So I probably, you know, Hmm. They have probably put a like closer to the other plus side if I could reach it there, like kind of where I had it before.

Down near the down here, the water right now near the guard. Oh yeah. Okay. The guards are here. Yeah. Really right about where I had it or yeah. And if I could I'm right a little bit. Yeah. You could. I think I would just try and do the hearing mode.

Okay? So for me, I probably wouldn't be watching the first 10 minutes. Okay. Well, I try and do that. We'll fight her. I'd be like, kind of hungry down. Like, okay, yeah, I'm really Questions. So you start to cash your spell Balfour and you do complete it and Think about You will eventually do start to hear Well, make reception check because you are near the river.

That one. Okay. So this is what you hear. He's out here alone. Shouldn't we take the opportunity to irritate him. He is a, he's one of the thought was citron, sir. We could He is by himself on God. There's a reason that guys is out here alone. Got so long because he doesn't.

Guards. It's a minute. Unfortunately, as much as I like your spirit and thought pattern, Pot. A young welders never been in a fight. A person who is passed their prime. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't even be able to give him a shape. This and we don't be dead. And then we don't only make the situation in the city worse.

But so I shot up. No, you will not try and take this man's life. And either will I Unfortunately, for the both of us, He is far beyond either.

Maybe a situation with different. You could have but that is not somebody that you will lie or even. Just we had 10 more people with us. We would be able to so much a

Not. Do exactly as we. Watch. Listen. Follow. But keep on weapons their sheets.

Right up. Do. That's only here. We got And then it's later. The stranger now guys is still standing on. The rock seems to be this pacing around it.

Yeah.

Of.

After about another 20 minutes so it's about 8:30 you watch us jumps from the rock. He does not climb down and just jump style. Don't play till or Riverside where you know, the cars like? No jumps, actually just straight down like into the river here. Sure. Okay. And then just walks, so yeah.

Okay. Through You watch, as he gets right up to where the guards are, the guards immediately likes step to the side and you can see those of you with dark feet. Well, actually those of you with dark facial makeup perception. What? God damn. You 15 50 30. You got one point in tonight two.

Is that everybody the dark region? I don't know. Okay. 15 Belthor. You can see that the 15 was, oh yeah, you can see that this man guy seems to stop and front of them. That's about all you see. I write, you can see with your dirty 20, you can see that not only has kind of stopped in front of these guards.

He like basically just dead eyes stairs at the older guard. Then looks at the young one and then just like, slowly, just leaves. What medicine?

Reaches down, grabs hold of this spear. And just you all audibly here up, Hmm, let me just turn the box away. Oh Christ.

You can also see iron that immediately after guys turned around and started to walk away that the young ones like took a step forward, but immediately the gold guard like, but a hand on his shoulder and this just shaking his head. Okay, after a little, while the guard start to follow him again but it's like 30 feet back question, so they're starting to walk back towards the yep.

Is there like grass or anything around us between us and like the cliff side? Like, you know, just kind of thinking comes All of this is grass. Okay? Like there's a little bit of grass here and like, on the sides, but this is like kind of like a sand path to grass, okay, kind of closer to the game or somewhere where you might be able to see us easier.

I was kind of wanting to do a solid image to make the grass in color. So conceal us a little bit more. Okay. Yeah. All we are not until already I say that you would know from I could position that like I could be half. This is like from where you're currently standing like here or well not necessarily standing but where you currently?

Oh yeah this is like 30 feet below. So to see anything he'd have to like really come around and okay. Well he got near the no you know, this is still that's still like 30, okay? Or so down standing, right? Okay. Because we're staying over here. Okay, that works and I'd say you could all tell that he doesn't even seem to be like, looking around.

He's just walking right back. Yeah, okay. Don't do it that again, I have the high grade.

Becomes you. And one, the rest of it is how he pulls the mountain down into the ground and now all right. The story of all the giant that would be a problem. Now he pushed it down deep into the ground here, only one would still win because there's high ground.

He doesn't need that. Have the high ground, it just needs to happen. Only in the leg. So my, my my toenails grow like an inch. So yeah you you wait long enough and die us has gone back through the gates and you watch the guards like take up their position once again.

Mmm. Okay. So we know it's probably around the time you're making nature, check just to see if you know about what type of things like, let me remove it up alone, do it. Oh, it's like not, it's like I know, Well, you can only go up from here, right?

Yeah. The distantly, yeah, statistically doesn't matter if I'm using algebra class. I'm say, after about 15 minutes, the story of both, after about 15 minutes, those of you with dark vision. Notice that there's all the sudden, the figure standing on the rock, who seems to be doing this? Yeah, it's quite funny.

Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead and climb there. Right. Anybody The others of. Oh, that's right. There's there's a little. Oh, right. You're a peasant that doesn't have dark shit. She's implying. See somebody now You can help getting down the road One down and out the meter. Okay, just play. Cool.

This is when we got we got practice. Not actually Tyra says that. Yes, Like what are you? This is not hold me, at least like hold your hand. Like I said, Yeah, I know. It's like fall and you be like You damn good. Listening. Is it like super treacherous or that is walk down.

It's a path. Oh yeah. I was like. I'm freaking. Yeah, just make sure you don't fall. Yeah. Should be watching over the series. Yeah. I mean, he's gonna have good feet. Anyway, where you going? I think I know where but so you do make it there and now that you're actually at the rock of sacrifice, it's remember I like spring like this is actually near the river.

Well the top of it is almost as high up as where you were just standing. I think I get up there. Okay. Well yeah I mean we all probably. Can you just don't have to roll four walks up to side of the wall? Yeah, if we only want one person, we used to do know it's Kyra.

The shadow, I'm say, once you get to the river, those of you with dark, fishing can tell that it's definitely a female figure. And she, while the colors are a little off due to the fact that it's yellow, you know, that she just up here. Also, we know that she said, It makes sense.

Yeah, this is a wall. Because if you start climbing up I'm not following. Okay. No, you're all at the wrong, exact sacrifice. Yeah, so climb up okay and acrobat I've let it to recommend. Usually it's athletic enough. Yeah. Okay, 18, yeah, yes. We start climbing up, we realized that there's actually about like third of the way up and you realize they're like not you're taking me indented like handholds because if you want to take me yeah it's easier for you.

I'll take. I'll take yeah. I'm gonna like hold them like this like yeah. Because I don't need their hands. So you know she get about The way up and then you look to your left and you just see your interest on steel. I know, sorry. So you get to the top.

I ride with Merrick second later. It's like, you should talk 20 Elios one one, you do. See once again Cara in the disguise that she had at the very end of the amphitheater, and she is looking in the distance and kind of going I just wanted to agree to meet here.

Like clearly looking in like the wrong direction and you know that was helium is clearing it autumn week, clearing yourself, okay. Oh, and we were I'll put married on the cliff behind waiting. That's really makes a lot more sense. It's a good thing. We were, we sold it. I assumed Balfour.

Told us the name that he heard apparently guy is visited the rock about 20 30 minutes ago because he weird about actual drone. What are you gonna do? Changing just to make sure that nobody comes to destroy this place. The fact that guys inspected it himself is probably the indicate that he wants to make sure that nobody has removed this and she shaves and you can see it's a light at all being with chains like attached to it that upon looking at it.

You see, this is where the sacrifice is usually strong up. They don't just stand there. There are thicks to something. So it's not at the Rockefeller but it's on top of it. Oh, so we're okay. Yeah. On top of it and there's a post, I created a map for it.

I'm that forth battle map, you know for what the rock. Oh okay, Okay. Anyway, Yes, he's probably making sure that nobody has tampered. With their Sacrificial location Mom. Suppose we wouldn't need to tamper with the actual location as long as we can. Do the business that we're about to make quite right?

I'm assuming everybody is. Yeah. The rest are just down below very well and she just walks right off and drops. Yeah, just look over the age. Yep, took 30 foot tall. I don't know. Lands directly even as a deity. A natural. One is a natural life but she lands directly on a particularly slick rock and you watching her legs immediately like split apart but you actually watch as she like perfectly like kung fu kung fu like plans on the ground in a perfect split.

And she looks up, Balfour, Kadeem. And Calek, though. You can all clearly see that that the expression she wears is one of I meant to do that. We've seen some horrible. Yeah, complete like I am embarrassed, but I meant to do that. I'm good now. And like, Like the kung fu like slowly just brings the legs together like Exactly, as planned.

About anyway, once everybody reads It's just yeah, I'm taking America. You're a mummy. You can slow fall. You know whatever. But I don't want to give the 30 football, you can eat it for breakfast. I don't want to be doing no just walk down. Just, I'll put back on my back.

I could already convene at the base of the rock of sacrifice and car goes. So, I assume you have an idea of wherever. We need to go remember. Problems, it's never easy. No, it's awesome. The prints over there earlier and if they go along the city, Side. Alright. Yeah mmm.

They can't just be right next. Nobody nice. Yeah. Shall we Suppose that all ready? Ah, let's have a margin. I mean, I figured many cars are probably because when I'm friends, yeah, don't follow right behind. Or I, well, if it's wide enough to go side by side, it would be side by side, but if it's single file, I guess, right position, it's wide enough for side by side.

Once you start getting a little bit more actually, it looks like it'll narrow that we'll cross that bridge when you get there. Yeah. All right, I would say we're an actual bridge, let's have a group dictionary check, because this is not a path, these are just rocks saving through or just a check.

Just to see how well the travel is going. Said group.

Okay.

But that expense not working at the wrong character. Ah I was like dick standing plus one, what the fuck. Don't. Oh no, that makes much more sense. Yeah. Not 20 for 22. 21. Well, 60 had these look boy. 21 anyway. Damn you. All right, everybody except for codeine, okay, had no problem.

You have to have the majority passing lose. A simple attack walking around already easily enough easily enough, you all smashed to support Kadim who's had a little bit of trouble with his footing at first look like, but without too much difficulty you have managed to make it after about, Trying to think.

Let's say I said that was about mile. And mile made to about this position after about. 20 minutes sure making yeah 20 minute mile, good not terrible. I would say 30 minute if you want to be realistic with being on rocks and mercurious. Well yeah, but I'm saying like you made good pace.

Well, that's funny. Yeah. This would be good pace. Yeah because I'm like I'm thinking of like hike. Yeah. Where you have the power? What Can take him anywhere maybe like an hour, you know. Yeah. But it's not you it's always the fastest. What do you mean? Do you mean anytime?

We hit hills dude. I'm like fall. Well, this is great. Oh, yeah, right. 20 seconds because you ran after me look at that point and after about 20 minutes. Sure, okay. And I'm probably going to ask for some help to see if we can see some more of the footprints.

Maybe I can see one, two, one. Oh, I actually forgot I was doing it. Yeah, I'll try to help you. Personally, I'll help you make a perception check. If that cash sends I raise helping. Like to have purple. Or she doesn't, Is that cockpit like it's barely? No. I mean, I can't say, can also sometime in the front, too.

No overall too. Sometimes I'm from it's not it's sitting on the surface of now 15 for me. Where is another thing flap? It's like barely any carb. What do you mean Like that? Oh, I see. Yeah, I mean yeah. And our rollers thing. Okay. I mean, if, if it moved, when you moved it, that means it was cocked.

So, all right, 18, 18, so the two of you looking you don't necessarily notice any footprints. However, there are a couple of other things that catch your attention, okay? What looks to be a very old and kind of faint, but still there. And Iraq, you help you are helping Bell phone.

So you actually notice it first by its sent, there's a very faint old blood tray leading in the direction, leading in the direction that you've been going, and I would say, also both heliocentes. He was also an velcro after after I was pointed that out, they even though he's still kind of following this quote, until hat, right?

Both of you do, notice something? That seems a bit strange. It looks like A piece of a stone of me from bird. Like the stone, like a sculpture. You smell. We shouldn't belong the right direction but but Spell it? Yeah, maybe from here. Probably, that would be the better option.

Maybe easier, right. Yeah. And I assumed this point we're gonna have to be going single file, right? Yeah, I'll leave you then I'll follow this now. Like carefully? Well, yeah. Next Thursday. Yeah. Okay. Give me 20. There's one more no shit, okay? Nine. Two numbers. Got said 20. What?

Okay, he said 17? Yeah, he said what was on the die? Okay, he added. And I that 20 to 23. Okay, you got a second that's 18. Well just died. Okay, so you have six passes in one family. So you still managed to continue on, right? Second, yeah, yeah.

Oh, six and Kylie. Yeah, your shadow. Look her dexterity modifier means that if I roll a one, she still succeeds. That's right. So I just didn't roll her. No you get to about here because it's definitely more hazardous. This is more like precarious and less like you know, a cat and I would say that that's where because you were specifically looking for it Iraq.

Yeah. There is a very low but Like heavy. Like when you take a moment to stop and like smell, there is like a lingering scent of blood but due to the fact that there's a rushing water, it's painter is the kind of thing that it would never make its way up the side of the cliff into the actual city.

Right. But now that you're down here, like you take a moment, there's definitely the scent of flood from where you currently is. It's still here. There's incentive blood. So everything so it's really hot. Look around firm entrance or maybe an investigation check That is a. Same time six and he was investigation check okay.

Yeah, yeah. Looking around for the, if there's a heavy smell of it here, I was looking for an entrance which somebody else would probably also. Yeah, I didn't hear I probably would have okay, hanging with dark vision and all instead, because I don't have a modifier yours. Is probably better than mine, really?

Yeah, yes, this is investigative, okay, plus two is better than a zero One of them about this since I'm smelling it. Yeah, with your smelling its Smelling it. What actually wants to see something to sing up.

Gets down on all fours. Okay. You're trying to look and find where this pave might be and you start looking more and northport sure, right? And right before you start wandering off and that direction you feel on your shoulder, A slight tap and then points directly. So, I'm sorry.

Oh, I need to move from that. To lose the. Yeah, I need to move back. Yeah, now I guess. Yeah, what's it starts pointing? Like, you feel like you see, Point and select them down. They probably like a darker spot in the water or something like yes it's still very faint right?

But there does appear to be a darker. A slightly darker spot. I feel like hero but happy man told her you look over your shoulder and you see Kira who's just Looking at the sky. So here we use this dumbass is like, moving rocks on our side around trying to what the fuck.

Where is it? Maybe on the other side. Remember that makes sense. Yeah white linker question. Yeah. Approximate how wide the river is here. Probably not the scale with the ones on the map. It's definitely not the skill with the left. Yeah. But I say Let's see. Now, it's just up at Tommy.

It's a mile walk. That's not. My said this was a mile. Yeah. Have a mile. Okay, roughly. Oh, okay. So half a mile. Do we think? It's like is it like rushing water or no, it is not rushing. It's a constant low, right? But it's not like the minute you get any you're being swept away.

I figured that probably is more like For that part. Because I think, Right? What? I'm at least thinking here. Okay. So looks just like passable in some form. Maybe maybe you might have to put in a little bit of effort. Yeah, I'm assuming it's gonna require athletics checks but yeah, should be good.

Top.

All things are possible through and I will do these. I will require me to do the performance creation to make a little boat. All right, I can make an up to a medium size. The object. I don't know how big the folks like just like a little boat. I can see.

Yeah. That maybe would probably be like a one person look like a little canoe. Yeah, yeah. It might be a canoe. I don't know. That's whatever I could make them like float. That's kind of thingy boat. Okay. I will make it. Okay. And it's like a tears. Yeah, I'll put it like on the shore.

Okay. Do that like oh shit in the river? Well, it's first time. Can you get that please? Wait. No, I'm going to let that go to teach you a lesson. I could go get it but I'm not going to Everything happens for a reason. There's a lesson here. Yeah I mean it yeah medium sized boat could probably fit like one person and maybe Merrick.

Yeah he can just walk into the water. The two of us at least can probably swim pretty good. Yeah. So I guess what? But between the two of you whoever wants to try to I mean you made the boat yeah. Poached with you like being next to the boat like I'll have to meet Are your lower it?

Huh. Maybe in the wire right? That's something else in my life. Yeah. You never drove world girls? Yeah, I feel like over this, right. If you touch the boat in the city, right? Oh, it just, I'm touching it separately. I didn't need there. That one. Oh, that does give me going though.

Are you? So you just made me here like music. You okay, maybe. And it has to be a seashant day, right? It's like a morning. It's a boat. Like I didn't touch the boat. You start to hear. What can we do with the drunken mayor? Whatever your favorite genre?

Yeah, like little like yeah. It's like barely another right. Yeah, it's like the background music that I can't hear well sometimes, it's so fine right now and it's really good. So one of the random. Yeah. That you are. I was just joking. You didn't have to turn someone. I just want to hear some of that.

What? I'm just like, yeah. Anyway, I'm back. Yeah, I Okay. Okay. Yeah, I can just well, who's doing? What? I'm getting on the boat. Okay. Very about you, hang on. Okay. Okay, I'm just gonna hang on but like, okay, inside of it. So Yeah, I don't know. Does it comment on it?

Probably not. No, just made a boat. Like, myself is like a yes. Okay, question the bottom or whatever. Okay, but yeah, yeah. So

Make a The two of you because you're holding onto the boat, right? I'm not. Yeah. Okay. I'm just holding onto the boat. Hello. You're holding on the road, what are you probably? Hold up. Okay, so the both of, you know, make sure checks there's the anger. Hold on, to the boat.

Sure. Make a All right, about this. Make a dexterity check for piloting. The boats. We just walked them bottom of the timer to two. Okay, it Out. The ground like you, it's deceptively deeply. What you're wrong, you're holding on to Immediately let go and sink to the bottom of the tracks.

I'm a 300. I was 300 plus pound, man. Yeah, yeah. Suddenly nothing. The anchor has dropped off the boat. It's so much easier. Yeah. Just grab this down and then just walk. Probably too deep but I like the idea you drop about 20 feet, okay? Maybe. Okay, so yeah.

What are you doing? And am I right? You also swimming? I was seeing if the spider climb actually lets you just do that. Can you just like What do you mean? Can I just not have to read? Yeah, not great because just kids you spider climbed under the water under the water?

Well I mean it wouldn't be you wouldn't even probably have to have a sweater climbing. It would be no different than walking across the bottom. It would probably help. Make sure you don't drift down with the current any, but okay. Yeah. I'll just use fire time. Just okay. So she just doesn't feel another one so far is now watching you three in the boats, slowly spinning away watches as palette immediately.

Let's go and sinks she watches this Irish just locks in and down the water. Looks you immediately just for an out, start swimming make it right making up. Pick up a number net. 20 for 20 seconds. You're just like Olympic swimmer. Freestyle. Having no problem. They are. You immediately are beside the boat.

And pass it and pass it. I help them if I could but I'm probably can't drag a boat with three. Well, people want it. I mean, that one. Yeah, you make it to the other side without any difficulty. Right? Before mom, you get to the bottom, which is deceptively lower, and you look, and you see Kelly, From how could you just like land flight in front of it?

I will. I hope our boat with a shovel can you? I'll use that as a paddle. Okay. Can I also I also well, it's I just figured out that I have a shot. Okay, so using shovel to paddle. Okay. So make a desk then yeah, make a text. Check to try and help could deem straight now and propel the boat back.

13 13. Okay, you've straightened out the vote. You are now going in the right direction, again, but you are now. Kind of stoled offers you're in the right direction now drifting so okay so today can I although I'm away from heliocentric Heels has gone helios. Oh, my Helios is here.

You guys have drifted up here. How far away is it more than one? Mmm. Yeah, but I yeah if it's a half mile wider, what I have to be. Yeah, yeah. It's more than 30 feet and we're floating. You are flowing this way. You are now straightening back out.

So you like your, your perpendicular to the flow. But you are now drifting away from where you need to go. This condemns help. With his help, I will have us up shape. Okay. You're not trying say how upstream now. Okay, make a strength check with advantage because he's helping 17 17.

Okay, me and Michelle. What's yours? Plus one. Yeah. 13. Okay. You are making your way next to the lowest study slope that's fine. We're gonna keep going. I'm gonna make him. Throw a rope, some more towards you else. See, I think you're still nowhere near close. Yeah, I was like, okay, I'm sure so that someone can He said two different things helios is not actually oh well anything others.

Sure there is no other show. Oh, there's no other. Okay, got you. Yeah, over over here. This is there. There is it's it's just cliff face, just cliff. Oh, there is no short. You are like, you've made it and you've like, latched onto the wall, got you. Yeah, I figured there would be a boat.

I throw out to the shower. What should we got it? Yeah, I don't mind misunderstanding. I figured it would be a little bit. You were currently just like, holding on to the to the rock scene, the word cave. You would definitely now being that close you can like tell your kicking just trying to keep turning water even though you're holding on your foot is like going further underneath you.

So it's right here. We're keeping paddling. Oh okay yeah make another stretch here hydra and Calicut what you doing? Yeah okay I don't like that. 14 14 look for anything. They they feel water. That's not bad for a little personal show because yeah must tell everyone. But to make an acrobatics check for your timing of picking up and putting down your platform, okay?

Because like if you have both like depending if you're timing is wrong, your spider is but there's no bottom. Yeah, this is a check for like like when people walk in Olympic speed walking. Yeah. Something yeah. Like maintaining always having a foot down. The one. Yeah, this is kind of like a timing check.

15 50, no, problem the forces and enough. You your time, each foot step perfectly, you manage to get right below Helios. Like you can look up and you can see heliosis legs as he's like, like still kind of like because again, like it smokes down and then slows back up, and there was shrinkage very clearly large, cavernous section.

Too. Okay. Hmm, tell it. What are you doing walking? All right, make a strength check. My hashtag believe. Well, oh no. Make a dexterity check to maintain like your balance and stuff because the river isn't gonna push you, you're too dense. Yeah, but this is about like moving corrections to me.

Yeah, there's about moving, it's a rock 16. 16, you may not that difficult you follow up right behind Iowa. So the both of you are at this entrance. So all right, in terms of underwater, the entrances underwater 14, 14 years like we're starting to lose ground a little bit.

You didn't lose a lot. I'm trying to lose ground battle, like you've never battled the far. Helping people work hard but just feel like it won't help. Yeah, they're gonna be exhausted by the time they get 16, 16, all right, you do manage to make them the both of them starting to get higher.

This is this is still a constant effort. Yeah. Yeah. The person like Helios and okay. And this point in time. Yeah they're underwater. You can't see higher or pallet at all. Yeah you got a better dice than that problem. Did that rope? They threw overboards, I think, okay, I think because I was like trying to go to shore but my son.

Okay, I'm about to go. So yeah, I'm gonna go and do the next one, right? And do the next one. What? I just seen Nick over there rolling and I don't know what he's doing. I'm just he's saying which dice is good? Because if we fail again, I'm gonna be very upset.

Yeah, I'll go ahead and try because I was hanging on to it. Okay. So you're gonna try and kick some help push. Right, right. Okay. Make us you. It's just strength. You're trying to perform right? No forward motion, right? Okay. And The two of you are helping, so with advantage, okay.

Well, and then, is that a fail? Because I do have a thing. Where if I fail that I can. Yes, that is a fact. Okay. Little drive, but we're pushing three. Okay, so, well, 50, you just meet. Okay. So You do move forward. Just a little bit. Yeah. To his helios, the image, mostly he is getting closer.

You do see him holding on the wall. Just going to throw the room. Okay, make a strength check. I'm going to maintain the road. Okay, over to him. There you can go the magic, go 30 feet so it's far as it is. I will say Helios, you see the wrong coming out towards you.

You have to let go of the rock to go. Also, the three of you if you have to make one more strength, check against the river. You'll get one point of exhaustion. Because yeah, if I'm close enough to get the rope, what I wanted to do is I'm gonna go grab it while first off.

When I, let go of the law, I'm gonna hold my breath, just to state it. I'm gonna get the rope and go down and try to get them to hang on, to me, to give me enough of an anchor that I can just pull them.

Okay, one more time, I think I got the vans mixed up the two that are under what are right now. There are anchor. My breath in greater up and go underwater to where they are. So they can grab me, and I can just hold them in like an anchor.

Oracle anchor. They are the actual I understand. Okay. So we are You let go of the wall, you make a The next check to grab the world. That's the first step. That is a 19. Do it with ease. You see the world? You Really push off a wall a little bit.

Grab the rub. No problem. Now you die. Hold your breath inside your folding onto the road making athletics. Check with With disadvantage because now you're holding something that is going to be taught. Long time is swim, not bad. That's a 16 16 you do manage to actually pull it a little bit up.

Reroll that and do it a straight roll because it would have been disadvantaged on your own, but they were all still moving. So it would a good advantage. I figured it was somehow gonna get worse. That's an 18. So a little better. Okay, 18. So you do manage to swim.

It's hard though because you're pulling three people and up both the three people in a boat against the current against it correctly. We have four now that like the rope right? Slack toddler beat anything. That's hard mileage. Yeah, I get it, they're driving me there. But actually do see like you watch as heels like jumped away from the wall died under.

And you see him like struggling towards the two of you. What he do. I'm gonna if we're close enough to the underground entrance, I'm just gonna jump in. I'm gonna tie these talking November, the ones under water? Yes, I'm like, wait a few. For what's happening? If Ira and Calico like right here, helios swam like right here.

What are you doing? Oh man, I'll try to grab the row. Okay, all that works? Yeah, grabbing him, grabbing the rope? Yeah. Grabbing whatever is closest? I guess I'll try to grab the row but not to climb. It just to kind of Place. Okay, so you both grab the roll.

Each of you make a sprinkler. At this point, she got also do that since I assumed that they're grabbing on to it that I get in position. So As a group, not the best. I'm gonna, I'm just gonna call out all underwater. That's go on underwater and I'm just gonna go down the road.

Okay, I'm gonna tie them up, okay? I'll tie them to myself and then jump right into it. Bye. I can't swim third enough. Okay. I can't sleep but like I'm sweet as fuck. So I'm trying to listen. Yeah well yes, I mean if we lose the boat that's a lot of drag that we're losing.

Yeah next. Yeah, yeah. So the two people grab on the throat. Did you just jump in? I jump. I was trying to use the rope as like a slack line. He's like I told why that's hotline climbed down. Okay, so you got in front of cadena. Yeah, yeah. That's what I was doing.

Now, as everybody's pulling the helios Ira and Kalik pulling towards the whole American and Val Thor pulling well themselves towards the whole, right? It would just be making it one final group, strength, check, everybody. Well everybody, You need more passes than fails. 19 success 200. It's not as easy as it could be, but all the mechanics do come together, helios.

You start making your way from your swim. I remember making way backwards the grounding right? Yeah, sure. We do eventually make your way underneath into the camera. Okay. There's still water. Yeah, the rushing, the not the brushing, but the flowing water has stopped. And now all underwater Helios. You've been underwater belongings make a constitution?

Well, yeah, I was actually gonna ask how long it's been because I know I can hold my breath for four minutes. Okay. Definitely. Not been for me because it's Abandoned maybe like, Thursday is 30 seconds. Okay yeah we should be here. Yes. Yeah just so you know the mechanics for that you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to one plus your constitution.

So so you're fine for the time being plus three is my con mode. Yes. So you're also you're also fine. I got three minutes. Yeah that's my second highest you're fine for the time being convenient. I usually go second second with come because I want to help And we're now on the clock, your underwater, the movie?

Yeah. Make an acrobatic check for those of you swimming. The two of you walking, you're just walking in. I'm just holding acrobatics and not athletics. No athletics so I get those next. Yeah got it. Yeah I mean I'm proficient in both I just want to make sure I'm yeah depends on this broke 12.

I'm not the most graceful but you still have plenty of air. I'm just still following the rope. Yeah, we're so you're just dead weight. I am. Yeah, I'm kicking because I mean I still have to do something to can't momentum but I'm assuming it's pretty dark down here so I'm not letting go of the world.

Well yeah but I you know I mean as long as you're not kicking you're not dead way. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm more or less just using well. Yeah. Using the rope is like yeah, what you're wrong. Okay. Just making sure that it wasn't any different because of it. No.

What was the deck or acrobatics athletics 14, right? Bounty. Finally got a double digit number. Oh, my 17. Seven was a good you're making. It wasn't just 11. Yeah. You all swim for like you're making relatively good distance now that there's no flow, right? I'm gonna go by. Okay, one ways.

It's very very dark. Even your dark vision doesn't necessarily help you here, right? You do not know if you're getting closer. Not I'm still going. Just yeah. Well, I'm hole in the road walk along. It's oh, there's no other option. Yeah, I'm like well, there's no I know you guys.

Oh because you tour walking Ira and Calic, make a perception. Make a nature check. Nature. Meter or like survival? Yeah, make a survival check. That's survival. You make a survival check. That's probably the best one for this purpose. I'll explain what I mean in a moment, okay? Trying to if that I don't know, survival survive, nice, the most so 30, 20, 30, 20, seven by walking.

You can tell you're now walking up hill. I figured that's it. But yeah. Right. This one none of you know that except for Kathy, right? Yeah. I mean I assumed since I yeah, maybe the farthest one was that I'm probably would be able to see if I'm gonna run into the fucking bottom or not.

Yeah, right. I'm just saying that. It's okay, right? Like, it's right. Yeah, right. Yeah. If you're like kicking. Yeah. And we all roll together. Yes, athletics fixing forgot. How to do, um, before I'm gonna take kicking, but I would also like to press the vegetation of just like a bit of light since it's instantaneous, I guess it would just be like, a flash of light, okay?

Like, but just hoping to see something with it, okay? Just everybody make a perception check as that. Flash of light happens. All right everyone. Yep because marriage is just kind of like waving his hand as a reflash. What does everybody say 12? 19 1914. 146, 68, back to the same Eric Ira and Balthazar.

You can see in that very brief flash, you are about 20 feet from an opening. A very like very clear just because like the light was different about 20 feet away. I scamper you know that you have one final push Are you making no problem? What was your final push?

15, 15, 15, 15, 15. You make another problem? Not funny that when you make another problem, Not someone 17. You start to panic the day out, trying to get, you know? Why with a combination of yourself like taking a moment? Like in your panic, you hear a very clear voice.

Calm. Cadia, watch the others follow their rhythm. Swimming is all about rhythm and flow, just like a sheet of music. The immediately, your panic starts to subside, you get a better rhythm. A better flow, you follow the lead of meric and helios who have a very nice rhythmic to their swim.

Mainly because they're not as panic. Why that doesn't you also reach the surface? A few moments later, Iraq and colleague. Just come walking that. Yeah, mm-hmm. Shapes like a top. And that's where we will break first. Oh, what is wet Minotaur smell? Like, it's just like one cow. Yeah, that's no.

Like black dog. But worse. Yeah. What what? Dog? But with manure and covered in manure. Well no but just the natural house that Mozambique, yeah, it's it's swimming time. We made it, we
