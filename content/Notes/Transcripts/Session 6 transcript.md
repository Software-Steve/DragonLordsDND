With python and possibly track down some of these leads for these laborers that the oracle told them about. Making their way to the city. They saw a Congress of merchants traders farmers entering the city from the southern date making their way towards that specific gate. They ran into a couple of individuals who told them of their recent, whoa, scanning the surrounding countryside as many of the nearby towns villages and farmlands had been attacked ransacked Basically destroy by recent grades scent arts and cyclopses Not only that most of their crops there lifestalk. 

Most of their possessions have had been given up as recent demands and sacrifices by syndrome. And the cult that's gone here in the city. Leaving them destiny. And with not much to their name. Making way in. However, You came to the guards of this, South Gate who demanded to know who you are. 

Well, was your purpose here upon inspection? Some of the guards recognize their companion, helios, as a former Well-known figure in the city due to his combative skills. Recognizing you, the lieutenant at position, send a message on to pipel You answered the city and you generally sense, this just kind of an overall sense of Destitute miss from the people of this city, a kind of bleakness that seemed to just hang over everybody as they wanted about their day. 

However, not long into the city, you were sought out by a number of guards, one introducing himself, as Captain Titus asking you to accompany him to the castle of Pythor. And as Pythorah had requested, your presence having a desire to meet and try and have a communication with him. 

Anyway, you decided to go with me, making your way to the Palace of python. You made your way in being led into the throne there. In the homeroom you found something you didn't quite expect. You found python, Half naked very clearly inebriated seemingly fighting the statues of himself, and the other deities, This seeming to put Cara even more on edge as she seemed to be getting more and more as you get close and closer to a story and as you actually entered the city. 

Again, his attention, pythor introduced himself and came on rather strong to certain members of your Being both Ira and his disguise sister of Carl. Not going over it. He made a couple of statements, which did seem to break cars control over her own temper. Words were exchanged between the two of them very angry. 

Some vicious, bitter words were said, Policy at which point debating that. Her presence would cause more problems than help. Upon her leaving pythor told you about his worlds about how all the loves of his life have been taken and killed by a vicious green dragon. For some reason, how the cult of the cult of syndrome and citron himself has demanded sacrifices daily and his most recent demand, is that python or sacrifice is owned daughter? 

And all. The last person in his life that he really cares about. Certain statements like that were, in fact made the presence of heels. Some awkward conversation happened between you and your father, really a strained. Awkwards. However, you brought to him in high, the fact that you were after these, these labors, that you were looking for clues as to what they might be where it might begin. 

And he mentioned that, he knows what they are and those where to go, but that to give up this information, he would humbly ask something in return. Some way to save his daughter as he himself, is rendered incapable of doing so. Conversation was had about this how to go about saving for going to the order of syndrome and trying to converge with the cult members to see if you can give a different sacrifice. 

Other than anora, possibly going to the centaur camp, this camp of centers, that is supposed to, if citrons demands are not cow taled to And given that this gathering army of centaurs will siege and delay the city. Possibly you go to him and you Do something most likely some kind of compact. 

Having not the best idea of how to go about this. You took your leaf and high though, making your way back out and reconvening with Kara. Some conversation was had between the two while Kadin. A specifically went over to converse with car. We seem to be gazing out over the city. 

Recommending with the rest of the group, you started to converse and express that, you thought that your next plan of business should be to go to this centaur leader, this sent our chief to have words with him and That you need to find here. You need to do learn of his location. 

People learn who knew who he where he wants. Responding to little strongly horror thought that this was a terrible decision and would only end in all of your deaths. And in a bit of back and forth, another idea was put forth. Perhaps instead of way, laying the gathering sent our army, perhaps that's not the solution of this problem. 

Perhaps the solution is the beasts that come to take the sacrifice where it's advantage. If they were to not be able to appear and devour the sacrifice, then the sacrifice could stay at the allotted time at the position for the entire day as demanded. And The demand would be satisfied. 

Conversations about that will happening and debate us to how to Present this scenario while pretending the farce was still there, but also eliminating the potential threat deciding that you needed to have the aid of an aurora on your side, helios and Cara went back in to the castle of Pythor to speak with her and try and Get her on your side, to get her approval and her Help in. 

Creating this trip, the sacrifice to happen. Helios, you met with your half sister? You exchanged words and she expressed her desire to get to know, you better or Happiness of being able to finally officially meet. And the regret that. Pythor is not exactly the best father event. But, You explained the situation, the plan that you had been developing. 

She at first seemed resistant to this idea as she was. She was and had been gathering for will to sacrifice herself to end potential threat to the city. However, about this, you were able to convince her. That while that is a very noble thing that a very noble and courageous thing that she is prepared to take on her shoulders. 

It is an unnecessary as this is a better alternative than sacrificing himself to someone evil and fisted like, Eventually, she did agree with your. Plan and agreed to be a part of this elaborate trip. Telling you that she would handle your fault to get him to if not agree, at least, not get in the way of this point. 

Making your way out helios human cora reconvene with the group and while that was happening, could you had the idea that while the plan was to go and find these basilisk creatures, where they are and slay them before? The day of the sacrifice would happen? Perhaps it would not be about idea to put some disinformation out after all because of Sidron has seems to have eyes in ears. 

If not everywhere, the name, a great many places Perhaps it wouldn't be about idea to convince the call that your plan wasn't. In fact, to go as originally discussed to parlay with this centaur and with your help of Merrick and Ira and Balfour, and Alexis you put on a A grand play of a decision, getting many of the soldiers. 

Honorable good, men to believe that this is the plan. He giving you what support they can and how to converse, how to find how to recognize, which is the centaur chief death. Reconvening, it was determined that at this point in time, your group had a lot of things to discuss and perhaps out in the open was not the best place to have it. 

After all the deception was done by Kadeem in the rest of you for a reason, it would go to waste. If you suddenly started to talk, and Suspicious ears. What's over here? So, thinking of a place that you could converse in safety, without the prying eyes, and ears of some nefarious individuals helios. 

So you remember the number of locations in a story places of business of Places primarily of gathering for private occasions. Also appearing and functioning as places of restaurants, but these beings special ones that first and foremost pride themselves in the ability for people to meet and talk in secret. 

Heading to one of these the seat, the silent spell. You made your way there order a room. Ordered food were seated. And orders were taken and given and That's what we would be stuffing. 

So the follow up sorceress waitress just left with your orders like, right? Tell beverage you need milk right now, you mean no? Right having you should feel ordered, okay? Wow. Well. No point in wasting time, right? Into these. Food and game. The food has. I'm getting ready? No. Just just like, well, sorry at the opposite of any time when we go out, Stephen got his appetizer first and I said, as opposites one, we usually go out to you got your appetizer first. 

That's because that's normally you. Usually get your your food blast. Yeah. Actually. Anyway. So all that stuff you are saying can even I think it might not be a bad idea after all. What was I think, as I started looking for, like, wait, never mind. She was with me. 

The he was something he was telling us all about his good ideas about how we were going to defeat the warlord. Yeah. Yeah, right was. But they were But I think it's a good idea. Well, America, we think we have a better one, What's that? Well, the top with the Nora went surprisingly, well, compared to the previous stalk in the palace, right? 

They had seen as though a nor was planning on going through with the sacrifice. She was willing to do that. She believed it was her duty to protect the city. Noble, but we can convince her that there may be another way. It's hard to modest helios. We both know. 

I did not do any talking. Fair enough and roughly. Well, if we were to kill the basilisks then They could not take her in sacrifice. And what the rules that are good barred here, put out perhaps of them, deflect, the cult attention away to the point where we may get going hindered, I wouldn't completely count on it but I'm sure it will certainly help in that endeavor. 

I mean, I'm not eager to go out against a whole army, but the problem I have is a, you said best lists plural. I'm not sure how many we could take on. Well frankly, we don't have another option. And I feel like a history is on. Let's see what I might know about. 

Yeah that's what's you can make a history check about best list. You can make a history check about this sacrifice, okay. And it's not a brand new thing. Okay? 10, 10. 17 17. You would know that this sacrifice on the Okay. The blah. Understand. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Sorry. 

Like the Rock of Storm. This is not something that is blending. This has been in effect for a while. You do know that it happens regularly. Usually every month or so you do know that the last time that a sacrifice which was just a cow too, best came out to turn it to stone and develop and thus accepting and sacrifice. 

Thank you. 

You would know that. Basilisk's group. Usually, Is they tend to be in smaller groups, it's not Usually, very large. Got it. And you know that even that is still kind of odd. Yeah. Still a lot. Yeah it's true. We just love number. And he kicks me under the table. 

Once might be with quality right now to answer your question, mark, when last I heard of the sacrifice taking place, I believe there were two basilisks rumored to have Accepted the sacrifice, shall we say? It's still not better that she just not come. Well, if she doesn't go and appear to try to sacrifice herself, the city will be destroyed while An attempt will be made to destroy. 

The city is how I suppose I should phrase that. Yeah. All right. To see. Yeah, next place. Well theoretically As long as we keep it with just, those of us in this room and enormous and she has been filled in already on the plan as long as we don't let it out that we killed the bass at lists. 

If she goes to make the sacrifice in the best, a lists just don't appear. Well, it would be a bit on her though. If they cannot directly prove right, that an interference was made, then the terms of the sacrifice should be met. Yeah, I would assuming, of course, that we do this task, I would like to stay during the entire time that my half-sister is there to ensure that And he called members that may not have been deflected by the rules. 

Do not try anything. Someone should be somewhat I was thinking on the rock with her, but That is my duty. You all mean of course have your own choice, okay. That could also help You know, with the perview, right? Yeah. Sacrificing the song as well. Hmm. Well, I not sure how many followers of sit around would know, but I see your point there. 

Maybe we should like all stay kidding except for you so it's like that's just so specials. So do we go kill the vessels before then? Okay. Yeah. Wouldn't one of us know how far it is to get to the Barack Obester from the story. You would know exactly where it is. 

You know, for a fact having lived here your entire life That the Iraqi story on is in fact oh it's just right there. Yes, got it. Okay, we're like okay, so yeah, got it. Yeah, I met wasn't sure would be this close, right? Yeah. So yeah because we could very well. 

The rock is just outside the city, we can very well go and find the nest of the best, a lists in preferably the night when we would be in West, likely to be discovered, take care of the problem. And then Proceed with the procession as I'm sure that you know the daughter of the king is not just going to walk out of the city by herself to the sacrifice, right? 

Do we know anything about These creatures. Actually, we can still be up. Well, did you hear anything at the college? You know. I did not study biology. I still need monster music. But is there no music that goes with monsters. Let's start like songs to soothe, the savage beast. 

Any salt pursues such as If I play, You seek hard kind of like with your first statement of any song can do the savage beast, kind of like seem to kind of like look often into the distance thinking about it kind of dragon. 

Birthday too. All I wanted was in these last about 3,000 years. I just wanted somebody to wish me a happy birthday. Oh, sweet adventure. Thank you. Yeah, just like shit myself here when I can't stop playing my fingers are not existed from place. Anyway. But perhaps we can find a library library. 

To research under someone who has nothing. But Maybe. Yeah, I assumed my earlier role was too low, to remember how the vessel is sacrificed people. Between you roll 10, you know, The only thing that you remember is a rumor about not a room but you've never gone person before but you've heard other people mention that the basilisk would appear the sacrifice suddenly seemed to turn to stone and then they would develop And as far as I know, what, typically happens with the sacrifice, from what I've heard, somehow the sacrifice turns to stone and the basilisks eat. 

It is how it is rumored to be carried out. Interesting. Might be careful. So, the way to the very least, they have Joel strong enough to chew through stone And you put, Maybe we could find a Months their manual or something. Maybe they have a weakness but perhaps a way to Not return. 

This one. Yeah, what I have learned from my history, check about like, how the thermostat like temperature hearing that all make. Yeah, 

Yeah, I'd say make a history, change you're. Well, traveled in this In this land, another 70 17, ah, exact same role, Haven't been much more travel and hearing much more stories in rumors than helios. Has you know that stories tell of people meeting people looking at the best sense? 

Not like, yeah, but you don't know if it's people have to look at it or if it's something the basilisk does, while people are looking at it, you just know that people have looked at it and some effect happens to them, but these are more in the accounts of rumors and myths, as you've never met somebody that has encountered a basketball and lived to tell, right, As traveled as you, okay? 

You think something about turning the stone? Jealous. Put the eyes. All right. No, might not want to get too close then. Well, that may work for you, but I mean, my phone does our resident goddess, have any wisdom to provide on the subject. Well. Now. Many songs about the gaze of the vast list being the ultimate doom of anybody, that would come upon them. 

She knows the same time of being honest. I have action until yes though, I would say bellflower is, right? And most of the tales and songs told are people finding ways to Of right there, comedians from whatever this creature does. So That might be something. There's also a tale of an individual who was a great fortitude, who managed to Seemingly stave off, whatever the best of us. 

So, She kind of looks around. It might not be as difficult for you helios, or possibly Ira, but I feel some might have a bit more. Difficulty, resisting teachers, kind of flexes a little bit. If you're well, catch me. 

Understand. Do we know anything about? So, The reflections, like what if you looked at a held a mirror over here? For that, I have no clue. I've never heard of a mirror being taken to a sacrifice To be an odd and seemingly vein thing to do. But more also be safe and cold. 

If we were going, I yeah. True. It's still better than turning the stone though. Well, 

Simply fight something you're not looking at. It's not the easiest thing in the world but also better than being turned to stone. 

I spoke to never really tried to find like a book or something like a library because that idea well it depends. When do we have to do this by the sacrifice? Was that in a week? Yes. Based on your conversation and you know that she has by the next couple. 

So she has been the sacrifice must be done about The weaker. So as a deadline, the next full moon. The frankly, I think the quicker we get this done probably the better. She could go to mock, you know, next two days. If she chose to, right, you'll say, oh I think the quicker we get this done and over with the the better all around. 

But certainly, I think we need to try to arrange this for the day after we try to take these creatures out. All right, then. Mostly we started about yeah. Probably about one o'clock at this point. Yeah, so we have time together. Just um and I wouldn't say could even if you want to try to find research in the library. 

So be careful about finding it. We would hate to do anything to disrupt our ruse at this point. I could put up. Oh yeah. Well, the monster monster book probably has a lawsuit. Okay, a tomb of foals. Perhaps 

And, Think that's all. We could also very care you know we could try. So by any equipment or version emotions If you. And I haven't cussed enough money. Unless the King wants the children. See, the thing is, the king doesn't exactly know yet, right? Unless a nor is told him by now, which well, I don't think based on the fact that castle has exploded I don't think she has told him yet. 

He's kind of what I was thinking. If you hear him yelling my name, She probably has. I'll be right there in the cooking pot with you. 

Think you can at least take solace in the fact that should he decide to strike you clearly probably told his punch. At least two degrees. 

Hmm. Well. If it's preparing, there are a number of Smithies. As you know, Just, that's perhaps weaponry will be found. Should anybody desire? 

I think I'll be ready whenever I. Okay, I'll probably keep that. So To do anything new. Think something. Let's see if I can created my crossbow. Hmm, or sort though? Okay, that's great. Yeah, not really. Now that should be this one. Yeah, that's pretty easy. Yeah but the amount of I can go with Kadim to see the books. 

Okay, you might find okay, interesting. It's very possible. 

Is there a library here? You know? Yes, there are. I assume many. Yeah, there's there's enough. They seem you do know that some of them seem to be specialized one is almost completely historical warfare. Yeah, that makes sense. You know that one is A general purpose, library that kind of has a smattering of everything. 

You would probably you would assume that the more all purpose, libraries are probably better bets. Oh, so we've been military history. Yeah. Them not spend. Well, probably giving myself too much credit. If I said I didn't spend much time there. I didn't really spend any time at the library is but I can take you to one of them. 

Very nice just lead the way and after this, after I get to my meal, I can't wait to see what I'm gonna eat. Well, yes, when we go, I mean yeah I just walks up about it. It's like we paid for an hour room and he's like 20 minutes. 

Just dips like I hurried about my food. I don't know what to say. A few minutes later you do here a Returning with the orders of the party of seven. If you would allow me to enter the same woman, kind of purple ropes long pointing hat walks in arms folded and everybody's prey is held along. 

And she just kind of stands there as plates are put in front of everybody, a cup. Yep, my cow beverage, a income of Milk. Is put in front of it struggle. It looks as far as you are able to tell it looks like milk. Hmm, I don't think so. 

Can food ales are put in front of people that are drinks. She bows. Please enjoy the rest of your lot of time and I hope that the food and drink is to your life. If there is anything else that you need, just think about many things. More, and she transforms. 

I'm going out there. You take a long hard swig of it and You thought it was? It looked exactly like Elkaira but you know exactly what this is. Oh yeah, bone marrow when pancreas juice. I've got now. It's very fresh. Like we can think that they just have a fucking cow on tap. 

Yeah. Open the tab on the vlog. Oh my god. It's no. It's even better. It has. It's got like the fucking stomach clean out. Except it's a beer tab. Yeah, no idea. 

I'll just kind of side higher. We know she's not drinking milk. Just because she had lost her memory at the time. Doesn't mean we don't remember. 

Like, how happy here? What do you think you doing? Do I like my meal? Do you? You ordered what I got? Yeah. Is. Make a constitution defender. Oh, like a story. You know what? I feel lucky about it. Yeah, like, all right. What That's better? Constitution checkers, say it is the same 20, no, not natural. 

It is very good. It's definitely different kinds of spices than you're used to and at first it takes you a little bit by surprise me but it's kind of like that first bite. It's just like Right. Absolutely. And then like, the more you eat it, the more like, this is actually very good. 

I wouldn't have thought to use these spices in this way. Oh, cinnamon and not making chili weird. Can we just see some things with more than just salt and pepper? And Dennis. What is this Guinness used me? A lot of I have much to show you. But this food is very good. 

I haven't had anything like it. Like it. So, I'm glad it is to your enjoyment. Why? That's milk, clearly it's milk. Instead of what shit's not. This house. Why does it look like? Well, I have no idea. No, I don't know what just switch one of those. I find more distinct. 

It's called, we literally are, we said the same word? Almost don't follow me, but she didn't have to tell me. That, that is true. Now, the reason that is, it looks like Bill is not because Arab Told you it's because certain clients like to keep certain things private whether or not she explains it that's her profit but the establishment It's known for things like this. 

It has a reputation. Wouldn't. Yeah. Fair enough. I suppose. I mean there was a recent merit that if you looked in her menu it wasn't exactly like doing with the real spiky, but the hero it would look like whatever she wanted. Fair enough. You see this? No. I like, just I was doing this with my tongue and I just like, sliders. 

Oh, I agree, dude. Can you tell? I don't know about that one. It's the same reason that you couldn't read my mind. Makes sense. Interesting. Yeah. It's just a crazy thing happens. So if you want my blood, No. Just down towards them. Oh boy, that's so said, completely innocently. 

I think, I don't know. That's have a conflict. Oh, why would you so just that? The literally thought of the same girl? Okay, I will explain. 

You've just seen Carla like sketch pad. Draw up. Very hastily in front of everybody. As I was about to start explaining draw a picture of like a person jumping off into a very deep way. Well, when I lost my memory, I have certain I've learned certain ways to control. 

When I lost that, that went out the window. So unconscious. Sorry it's why I've been doing shameful. I've had never do that and kind of thing with Been. But you did it right? Yeah, no. This is blood more delicious than anybody else. Is worked. Well, he was just a yeah because it looked tastier. 

Is it smelling things? Not really, I mean, It's just to have who I am about. Interesting about now, no. I might want to. I mean, I have never had blood before. I was like, I didn't know that was the thing. I'm not on the menu. Well, you were arrow back then. 

So that is why you want to travel the night. Yeah, All of the sudden, it's sunburns. First. And then just look at the code of first and in the top, right? Still burn. Couldn't hurt you. Like if you are out there, your son is a What you're done. No problem, just kind of like she would have died because of the sun being, I think she wouldn't be sitting here. 

And it's rallying five days. Maybe over time is what your thing started. My nails hitting these so fast where the only had to resist. Well, it, I haven't even today, you know? I forget time it happens. That's actually character Steve. Does you must always stop every day with breakfast? 

That's breakfast. 

Just like, you should know. Sorry came as a surprise. Alright, I mean he's a lot. Just was curious, I mean, you're traveling together. Little bit of that. Very interesting. I've never met anybody. That just does that. So is it like us with food? Every you have to do every day or it can, Just so we know so we can help you. 

I've been trained to go Well, I couldn't. I mean, I still have to eat food. Oh, too. I love cheese all the time. Both like regular food. Yeah. Yeah. For the record to be. You do see that in front of her is not just the glass of milk but is also a very rare like only like lightly heated milk, very cook and steak marketing like cut of meat. 

That's the girl first. But kind very much maybe a little bit more, but like it's pretty rare, it's rare than any of us would. Steaks where they like, it's like 10 seconds. Yeah yeah it's like night. Here. Yeah. So I I'm sorry. Little usernames. That's what helps me to. 

And now, I'll be unconscious for Once it's Go for that. Just like wires at the metal. While we're putting air, I did also get one set. We didn't know ones happening. It was like the first one was, we didn't know what to do. I mean that's why it wasn't very powerful stuff I made very Other people. 

Again. What you should know, like, 

After the fake one, nothing happened. I just decided not me. I don't know, I don't know. Okay. Kind of surprising everything all over something special. 

Or any other long-kept secrets we want to air out while we're in the secret room. Ding, Dang. I already did. Yeah. You know, yes, literally doing an automotive like what your character was doing, like, maybe when he beats he like, that's what microwave beeps leave like, what do you? 

He doesn't even eat. Yeah, I don't know. He might like drink oil or something, because of her trying not eating before. I wouldn't want to How do you know? It would be good? Because I'd love to Because that's it, our posts just who doesn't love to eat. That's why I love to try different foods. 

Sorry. What would happen if you ate something? Like that. You? Yeah. How like my hidden amount? Are you kind of has like the like thing. Oh like a big. Like you're yeah. It's like a big under Josh and you never actually see it over anything, right? It's just kind of like a speaker, okay? 

Oh We don't get food. Exactly. Think What's it, The lowest? I mean, they are basically chickens. The chickens don't fly either. Nobody else. Don't fly like other birds but they can fly. I mean, if you're talking about what's wrong. I'm also clicking still do that one, so why? 

Just finished. Hmm, very good. It should be compressed. Well, and see fairness though. I don't think we're really paying for the food That is We went up into it. Well yes it's part of the room for you but yeah. Bonus. It seems like it's a courtesy You're largely paying for the secret. 

So Even necessary for an undertaking as we are about in. Embarking. 

I can't think of anything else I want to bring it. Yeah. Huh, I still don't like the plan but I guess you're right. There's no not the much of a better choice. What don't you like about it? Just seems like we're in a difficult situation there. Well, yes, that is certainly, true. 

First one, 

That's a great question. I have a feeling this song is not going to be. Also true. So maybe we'll take care of it already. I'll put a dude this way mark. Today, I met family that I didn't even know I had. I will do what it takes to protect that family. 

This is that is it's not a burden. I can ask of anyone else. I will undertake it alone if I have to, but I will be undertaking it. We will I will be there. I have to. It will also always have to stand up with for what's right. Green light. 

Don't talk. Let's do what is it? 

Hmm. Entire continent and danger if we don't do this. So I don't see a reason. Way to back out. So in chose, 

So one reason or another event is true, maybe But now I get. But wait. We're gonna go forward release. That will match as well. Hmm. And besides work. What else said boom. I think there might be things that you're looking for as well. It's very possible. It's a bold out of lucky. 

German death Bengals. It in front of them. Just out of his family. Yeah, what we've heard them, two of you hold on. Let me get to the merit page. Hold on, it's blank. And stuff they saw later from the restroom. Well, okay, there's a, we've heard them this, remember, the shooting starstone was she just said there was near our tests, so maybe you'll find that on the way, is that group knowledge? 

Well, the Oregon said. Yeah, so it was the Oracle who didn't who just said that was making it again, clear? Yeah. Yeah. No. I just, I couldn't remember what was in the dream and what was it? Well, I'm telling you what, he was gonna say. Yeah, we definitely don't know what was in the jury. 

There was one more cuz I don't think anybody talked about, it's very possible. Have darkness in that. Which I think is a very It's very possible. I'm always on the lookout. What do your stones do? I don't know. I just, I just know that I want to get them back together. 

Okay, it seems like it's just I there's a part of me that's missing without the Perhaps, when you have an assembly that you will find in your world spur, It's very possible. I hope not to not to wait that long though. What do you mean? Growth spurt. That was the magical thing. 

What happened to see? What happens when the user found one, you have one. I have one. Oh, I'll pull it out. Yes! The blow that looks quite tasty, you can look at it. It is very tasty. That was a Steven Joker. I do not want Medicare. So Americans America. 

Reassembles all the lucky charms, They changes from my half lane to a whole lane. Gigantic and 30 feet old, okay, literal devil, like tenacious day. I am completely. Them. Now a hopeless. Man, if you wouldn't mind, man, take a look. Absolutely. Kind of hold it up. It is really tasty. 

I don't. So goes from a holding the stone to like holding the chain like goes does like this, make like holding it originally, you say that. Grabs the chain like yeah, like No one will believe that they're magically delicious. So do you eat them? Or just like them? You can just like it. 

I wasn't planning on this. I haven't, you know, what did they feed it to the best of this because they don't, I would really rather not with us. Maybe not a good idea. 

I don't assume they don't actually eat stone. I would assume that they have some sort of mechanism that makes it available for the 

I would not lose, I never plan on it, it's always next to me art. 

And it's probably pretty appropriate. 

And I would not recommend treating it to this, I was never planning on it. 

Only friends get to lick it. I don't 

Oh boy. Can I just ask why? I told you nobody would ever believe me but they're magically delicious. Yes. But how did you just cover that? Oh, that's a crazy story, really, you see? I was asleep. And somehow I through rolling around to just kind of got up to my mouth and I, yeah, I licked it. 

In your sleep. Yes. And and it woke me up. Fascinating. And what do you think it tastes? Like it's hard to say. It seems to change every time I look at Mostly like sugar though. 

But sounds about right? It was so weird. In in my dream I was I was eating a marshmallow. Oh, 

Yes. Now This time we oh, you're not have any marshmallows here. I've never read this enough. It's really, I don't know. Used in like the flavoring. Was called a marshmallow. Yeah. It it's a home. Yeah. Yeah. It's a plant. You see? It's a plant that comes from the swamps. 

Yeah. The marshmallow and you'll whip, you know, whip it into a I don't know how to say this, like a Actually of blanking here and what that's called, what will? Yeah. But what is was the fancy word that chefs called phone. Most applications. Yes. Also, they also use it into a most like Thickness, and then you hate it. 

Right costume? No, I have not once heard or have this marshmallow. I don't think I've lived adventurous today. Interesting, you might be able to find them on the original love. There's more marshes that area. Oh, very interesting. Like it always that would always remind me a home play from the original region. 

No, but the marshmallows would remind me of home. 

That and open green fields. Sounds longer. If you don't like, yes. Now. Obviously, I know that you and I on are not from here. You were not born here, right? How did you get here? Exactly. This place is not exactly easy to come to and not easy to be. 

Who don't know that. I just suddenly like, I found this charm, you know? Well, my, my master had given it to me and it almost seemed to call out to me and I was just kind of wondering around outside of the city and the last city I want to. 

You see, I adventured around for a while after I turned 18. But last last place, I was somewhere in the sword post. I I just got the urge to leave there because I completed a bunch of quests for this in keeper and I I just couldn't find any more lucky charms. 

But then all of a sudden I I walked off and I was here. Just popped into existence. Yeah, five that's heard of this sword post. Did you end before we found you? I've landed on the beach. I just kind of appear there. I believe we saw them up here on the beach was like lightning or something. 

Something lightning crack of thunder. It seemed like something of the sword, but right. It was some sort of teleportation magic, but I would, I couldn't tell you how to do it again. Are you? Think. I don't think so. I'm just a, humble wizard. I mean from the stores? Yeah. 

Hmm, I can tell you could be he is not the God, but Something did happen that brought him here. Hmm, I just kind of get to, I just kind of get the general idea, the to head in a direction sometimes and then That I just kind of let fate decide where I go and it kind of brought me here. 

I couldn't say why. Okay. Correction. Thank you right now. I just know to be here. My charm, led me to, to somehow to the till you got you. Fellas. And then the Oracle is telling me, I'm part of this prophecy or whatever. So I figure I might just welcome along with it. 

So you follow faith. I suppose you could say that. I don't believe it's a coincidence, if that's what you're getting at. I don't think it is a quit since now Seems to happen for a reason. The properly dance. For what that reason is, it's not ever is not necessarily clear to me. 

I'm open time. My magical. Bring me closer to the reason. I'm sure you'll find the reason. That's the reason I'm a definition. Was it had very much like this to peek into the, to the future of it? If I could see where I was going before I was going there could be very useful good. 

That's all the hard the Right to see. What does that take me find out. I don't know. I've never done it. And who's to say that? What what I see is the absolute truth. True future. Train them. 

It could only be one possible future. History is always being written. Each step we take. 

Don't. Well, should we? Go about up, is it? Now. Well, then if you want to lead us to the library, I'd very much like just to see what else they have. That's which is a seed and one books are. It's like I've never seen a book of color. He says, as his spell books just like in his pocket it just gets angry. 

Oh, she never seen a book but no he looks down at it. It's not about. It's just like an iPad. It's talking about it's a bunch of sticking notes into a plastic bag. Where is it? Where's my phone? All right. Well, all of us are not going to the library. 

That might, I would like to go to the, wherever the bows, I guess Smith. Full weapons job. All company Arena. Ira. Yeah. I'll go as well. I don't see any for all of us to have enough gun. The library. Yeah, having an plus wherever tire, once they go, he couldn't stop her. 

If we tried, she just goes where she please. Oh yeah, thanks it's best. If she is, I bet she could be in two places at once practically and I'm sure she could. Right. Everybody has some Is very But I've seen you move your quick. That is true. Well, Bookmar. 

And As it what a teacher. Be a bookworm or you both just put words. After the library. And of course, if anybody else, I'm taking my new friends to the little library in the city, they've never you want us to look at And also that anybody wants us to look anything up specifically. 

Changed now. Because, yeah. Okay. I think it goes fine working. At this point, the hostess comes back and he watches she stands there for a couple of seconds and then the door is weird. Kind of shimmering seems to eventually go away and she goes oh yeah. You'll what time is us. 

If you so desire or need to, you can get an extension or if you are completed then we will check you out and learn business as can included. We were just getting ready to leave. Very well. I hope that it was to your liking both, of course, privacy and the food. 

I've never tasted anything like it. 

Why would that be? I mean, she knows where she took. The order wasn't healios gave his order and then he said what he had. Yeah. Oh yeah. I guess she doesn't know this from somewhere else though. That's that's just never happened. I just never have it was very good though. 

Hmm. Well, welcome to our finest story of for the first. It's a pleasure to meet you. Professor is not and you are Maricelress. A pleasure yourself, Please follow me. Feature back out to the front kind of desk. Kind of rifles through some pieces of paper that seem to have things with down on it. 

So. Oh, and however, for me and seven wheels that will run you a total of about 120 gold pieces, please. And unlocks up very well. And here she goes pieces. And whenever And woman takes it time to slides the money off the desk into, you don't know what you don't hear. 

It hit anything very very well. 50 and you will never hear and you will actually watch as the pieces of paper that she had things written just immediately. Tonight, like trying to ash and in the ash like swirls up and turn into bubbles that just kind of pop. Should you ever have any of our services again? 

Please remember this. Of course. Look at them. Do you as well? All right. You make your way back outside. You are currently another. 

So who's going where? I mean I'm going crazy. I'm saying, okay let's take a probably before we go straight up. Really? Two hours or so you. And meet back up. Told us. You know, what would be a good? It's about to meet back up. Well. I figured that if they were going to do business, I figured that I probably won't take too long for everybody to run their earrings. 

So I will go into 

And she actually pulls out a map, so she kind of looks at it, I'd say Helios, why don't you bring everybody when you're completely with your business? Why don't you bring everybody? 

To this establishment. Yeah, and you recognize it as one of the nearby Inns that are right on the edge of the And right near the amphitheater, excellent. Sure. This is for everyone. Sure. And, Could be both girl. Thank you, Cara for paying for the movement that needs to be also used to. 

Yeah, I was very generous and It is quite literally one of the least things I could do. And thinking about it, seeing as I assume that people might be Looking to procure, some things for business. She reaches into her bag and She gives. Higher it up for iris through a small bag of About a hundred gold pieces. 

She gives a small guy to. So are to depot. Oh yeah, that's great. So it's a hundred divided by, oh, a small bag to condemn, that also has Treatment, just in case, I rather assume that. Very glad some of you probably set out with Light markets. Me indeed, you are most kind you kindness, never fares to in fact, I know that you left home without your life. 

To speak the rush. Well, not really Yeah. But I don't know. I will see you soon. And she turns and very slowly walks away. To you very slowly because I assume she read this guy. Yes. Okay, she takes a couple of steps and a song looks back down at ourselves. 

Yeah. Anyway, she's saying she's very quickly, like, almost like seems to blur slightly and then standing there, you see a relatively tall, eleven woman, long, blonde hair, braided down her back, kind of a bit more glowing kind of dress, that seems to be a much more like stylized type of summer dress. 

And she just said, well, They'll have 33 gold to each helios and milk. He's got 34. You don't think I had anything. I needed it for the moment. Well, just be something. Hang on one, do it? You don't know. Well, let here, let me see, I'll tell you what. 

And at all, take the 606 and get it to here. If you can grab me a healing potion, that'd be very grand. Okay. I'll see. Function, just in case. Yeah, look at some from the we have our message by six potentially. Yeah, leave us know how many of my bag. 

It was six. I didn't put in my inventory but I wrote down six potions of human. Oh, so you could just one each. Yeah it's funny. Yeah. Why don't we just you know this is just tribute. Yeah you got those from the alco. You. Yeah yeah. So we do have that written down. 

I remember someone else. I did not. Interest. No, that's the feature. On it doesn't option to get rid. Also diffuse work keyboard, which is better. Okay? Yeah, there's a regular position coming right now. There's the regular place to use right here. Bring everything. Yeah. Maybe we can't go wrong with questions. 

Wish you the whole casting equipment. I don't have a focus. Focus. Well, after the library I'll just go running around another one, right? Okay. And give me the change. Yeah, make a investigation. Check to see if you can find your way to the library. 8 8, It takes show why Helios You want exactly the most? 

I mean, I didn't spend it. I didn't spend any time, so there's a lot of really no precisely. It's location but having lived here for a number of years you do eventually find your way to these general. Where was it? And in this song, I was supposed to look. 

I think she Okay, eating. So we'll start with this week. You make it away. It's a library. Oh, it's a fairly decent size on. Nothing. Super intricate or eye catching pretty. Generic building. But it looks sturdy and willing. On my friends library of a story. Thank you very much, not that I've ever been here before, but here you go. 

It's lights. My heart officially books, once again this bed. Weeks. And then, I'll just walk in. All right, e3, walk in and you're immediately surrounded by books. Like, the shelves are stacked high, and they start literally on at the entrance, okay? But you walk in and to your left and right, there are already books. 

And there are rows and rows there sections that seem to be not books but are scrolls and there are like especially designed cubbies for scrolls. Books. Binders, all kinds of different things. Some of them, you can actually see that they're gated off sections and they're a couple of ones that seem to be actually like, under locking key. 

Like, you see, you've kind of see some of like the higher up sections. The ones that you literally can't like, get without help fun unless you decide to climb it and you feel like it's tall. There are some light small like, changed to a lock, that seemed like keeping them in place. 

From your current position. It appears to be empty except for an older, an older man probably in the 70s to 80s by the woods of him. Kind of a long white beard that comes down to kind of the middle of his chest. Bald head seems to be actively like Rewriting like has a book open that seems to be very weathered and seems to be transcribing into a different building. 

Hi, and welcome to follow up. Thanks, I'll say hello my friend. To you, Good afternoon. Excuse me. Any kind of puts his drill down. Takes a section. Well. Actually. What can I do for you to reject? Well, we are looking for knowledge, we seek an excellent thing to be looking for. 

You see, we're on the lookout for any sort of tone, or any, any information you can give us about local creatures. Local creature firm releases deadly. I see, I see had some running with the centaurs and the cyclops, as I assumed. Yes. Yes, you could say that. That's my we're also just interested in biology. 

Hmm. Just my friends here on aren't from a story not as familiar. I would. To that they wouldn't be but they have a good guide in you master heroes. By things. You. Are incredible warrior. YouTube kind. Oh, Is the least I could do is, how much heat lined my pockets over these. 

Now, ready to be an assistance. Well, think about it this way, your stealing combat has helped me be able to maintain She and keep knowledge. Systems People are too ready to. For its the past, it's not important. You'll You have no idea how much I understand. To us. It seems you should have come here earlier. 

I don't know what you mean by that. My immediate friend oh, I was talking to Helios. Apologies, apologies. You are looking for knowledge on features and yes, please stands off and he it seems a little shaky and first, but he kind of, you know, he kind of stretches and you can hear like the pops of somebody that's been in a position for a long period of time. 

And he he kind of pulls off this long like almost chain of keys that like he actually puts over his shoulder and like wears it kind of like sash. Oh, let's see if we can find what you're looking for. And I would like somebody to well he's going to make an investigation. 

Check see if he can remember. Oh boy. That's a natural one. No. It's here. Who are you? He takes you off in a direction and you you start to realize something. This building is not ordinary. Mmm. It's much bigger on the inside. Of course and you you walk for about 10 minutes in a single direction before he goes. 

Wait a minute, this is Okay, pulls up. Pulls a book off and inspects it can't stand it. I'm going to No, nope, mistakes happen. Mistakes happen. Please this way that. No good for snapper has stopped organizing these things incorrect order. This is not where a section is and you actually do. 

See a sign that says, what something along the lines of biology animals, creatures of various kinds. But you look at the books and they thinks they say things like metallurgy, How do I identify granite and you can see that the type of animals. Branded because apologies, it seems that one of my Hired staff is decided to be neglectful in. 

Putting back the books that people return to us. No worries, that happens. If you would, Perhaps we should all spread out a little bit short and find. He put those books everybody that wants to make an investigation check Make a second, Suppose I show. You have, that's about what I figured results. 

Are fitting character. Three, three. 19 19. So you all kind of spread off into different direction helios in moments. You don't know how you got here, you don't see Merrick, you don't see Kadin, you don't see the the bill the librarian. You don't hear them either. That's fine. You look up and you're in a section about dolphins. 

Not the section. I would have figured I would end up in but fair enough. Mary Kadine the library, you all walk off to a district directions and like you're you're looking at the signs. You're looking at the book titles, you're looking at names and you start to see a pattern and all three of you come to the same idea. 

If The section of biology and animal science is has metalworking books. What is the metalworking section have? And you all go to that section and you reconvene, even though each of you walked off in a different direction, the three of you reconvene and you do see books on local creature, local wildlife, you see monster to be wary of things like that and ah well it seems that we all had the same general. 

I the It else. You do not share that? Yeah, I figured Oh my, um well I believe that the individual who will get a lecture later has played the books. You are looking for, in this section, if you will excuse me I will go find our missing. Thank you. 

And he wants them. It asked, you find yourself in a second about flowers. What, mmm. 

Dean America. What are you doing? And I really look at that monster book, right? Making association. Check to see if you can find what you're looking for to have 10. Ah, you find a lot of you're trying to skimp through it quickly and you find things about centaurs, the physiology where they tend to stay there kind of habitation patterns. 

They're travels. A very basic description of, like, they're mentality general, you find a couple of things about Cyclops's and the sort, I you don't really seem to find any thing about Non-planes features. Okay. Eric the main investigation check. Oh boy. Hey if you're looking for books too. Yeah, look at the news. 

20 20. You end up being a little better off. You find a book that has more descriptions of creatures that tend to stay by sources of water. Specifically, rivers and lakes. All right, and there is a description of You had a 20? Yeah. All right. Non natural natural funny. 

Yeah not natural. Okay what happened once? So you do find something a section on basslets so that they do like to stay around sources of water though. They are not specifically amphibious or aquatic by nature. It does talk about the fact that they tend to like to stay in. 

Caves or caverns as dens. It tells you that these are medium monstrosities. It would tell you with a 20 that they have dark visions that they are not intelligent. Yeah, that they Don't, they are not very perceptive creatures. Good enough. And with a dirty 20. 

Take. Take a look at this. All right. What is it very? Oh no. They they body swap. Okay. That if based on research. Yeah. Tentative research not fully proven yet. Yeah. That the basilisks. Ability to create stone. Seems to require the best solace to have sight of its target and the target to be able to see it. 

Got it. So what is kind of a little asterisk of? We don't know like to be fully proven. Yeah. Yeah. Like general general observations seemed to indicate repeated testing shows that these things these things can lead to this. Yeah do not know if we're quiet. Yeah. So if we put a blindfold on the vessels what do you think about that? 

Could you just have to not? Look at it? That's right after all. What if we I guess you're just here whether we blindfold the best through English and continue this talk elsewhere. At this point, helios do have any if you find yourself into a rather interesting section. It's almost completely empty. 

Except one book with heavy locks on. Oh boys. You get to forget it knowledge. Really That literally it does not have an author. It does not have like a date. It is very, very old looking. It simply says deities. Hmm. 

I don't think this is the right spot either. You eventually hear eventually cheer up. My friend here goes. Yeah, the how did Hit. Yeah, I think I took a wrong turn or seven, no matter. No matter. Your friends have found the location, unconsciously my idiot. Apprentice managed to swap the section of books. 

If you're following me, we can lead you back to them, of course. Need you back, That happens while the two of you were searching for books. And as you find this information, could be you see the old library and helios walk one. I put the book back. Yeah. Well, I managed to find him. 

He was You know, I still don't know how you found your way down. That it's couldn't tell you. Interesting. And we have learned much about this empires. Which will be a great help. Was you were you were able to find what you're looking for? Good, good. Many of the many, many passages are very interesting. 

We'll have to be coming back. My doors are always open for those who seek knowledge, after all knowledge is power no matter what anybody tells you Even you remember that? These are important. So is that very true? Well, would you like to check any of these out? I think we have what we need for now. 

We always like to give our hands dirty in the field. Very well If you want to company me to the front desk. It's a very central not checking out anything. It's a very small charge of the library simply three. Copper Sure. Of course If you follow me And lead you back to the front desk. 

If there's nothing else that would be three copper one per person. Oh, Thank you very much there. Till then. Very well, thank you for your donation. It is much appreciated. I'll be sure to go see it. Run through our seats just like last time. Very good head on them. 

Wait, who the library now? He's looking at healing. Why? Yeah, my next fight in the arena is gonna be against you. Wait, do you mean, who are you asking, if he's looking at you the library. Okay, are you doing anything? No. Okay, the DM is confused, but okay. The meter even in the flight is even like. 

Oh cool donation. America doesn't have to pay. Well, I mean yeah. It was covered. Yeah, but yeah you already he aren't. You already took the payment of using the library in the books, right? He helios. As far as he's concerned, helios is just given a donation to the museum, that's fair to like maintain it and run it. 

Well, first marine, okay. Well, on tonight, DM was a little confused by that one. The only one. Anyway. So the three of you take your lead, we're gonna pause there, we're gonna swap over to the other three. So I rebel Thor and Kalik, you watch helios walk relatively confidently, a couple of paces away stop scratches head. 

Immediately just in the opposite direction with me again following, they might be a while. Well, is this whoever you're around here? He'll be fine. Something with other complaints. Okay? The doors, He's ready. Yeah. Hello grabs. The is there like a certain area to maybe movie pass through? Or like that's certainly part that okay person. 

Excuse me. Yeah. Not good long boy attitude. I too told yeah I was supposed to run. I'm not telling you. I mean you don't see everything in everything that's like thank God. Oh okay. So looking around about Thor kind of leading this expedition. It doesn't take you long, your loss. 

Yeah. You do not wear. You do not know where you are. Not the same thing and you don't have the map. Sorry. You don't know where you are currently, right? And maybe we should ask for help. Probably. Yeah, I probably should. I know what? Yeah, I'll walk around. And the probably the guard or someone since we were here activate, the palace. 

Okay, make perception check. At the item. Okay, what's better? You look around and you don't see any guards per se, but you do see a couple of, well, look to be for lack of a better term. Merchants dwarf, among them with dwarf, couple humans who seem to be kind of repositioning. 

What looks to be? What did you make as you understand? You're not fully sure. It looks like metal of some kind that they seem to be like, situating on their card, like repositioning it to like, make sure it's like stays down, right? Okay, can I go through only one? 

Third done. Trying to put it on the car right now. Interrupting them. Yeah well it seems to be in the car. They seem to be like moving it. It's kind of the car so you can't really see specifically what it is right? Because there's a lip. Yeah they seem to be like reposition Okay. 

Yeah I'll go at home and I want to say enormous yeah you know. Excuse me, friend. The dwarf turns to you. Looks up. For indoors. I didn't expect to hear sulfur tones of my language coming from. If you're excuse me, someone with your physical features appointed here, rusty, but rusty, you might be but you are quite good at it. 

Thank you. My friend is looking for anybody, Do you know of And merchant around that. It looks past. You looks immediately at Calicut. I am assuming the bigger one. Let's see. And it turns over. We bomb those, He turns to the other two and they start kind of a very quick conversation amongst each other. 

I the north turns back. Well, if you're looking for a long range of what, I'm real various kinds, there are a number of locations that do sell things like that. Depending if you want something made, specifically, you could go to the Valkens Hall. Instead old salty seed, dog. Well. 

That's not really an app name because he's not a sailor but he acts like one person he can make just about anything. So I suppose he might have something on hand, if he's made it or you could order it specifically. But there are a number of other Specifically cell shops that do store weaponry are various kinds. 

I won't deny that, I don't know what their supply might be to be in at this point in time. A lot of it seems to be going to any points in the northern direction right there. But I suppose it couldn't hurt. You can try the shops, it's not far from where we are. 

Actually, you have to go any gives direction and it From where you're currently standing your right up in this area. As it turns out, okay, as he's kind of giving you some bearings of where you always see the river. Yeah. And you see right next to us, he's pointing back down this direction specifically pointing out. 

This is the location of Vulcans Hall and that a lot of the shops are actually pretty around normally are in. Okay, so this. No, oh boy, I got this. Okay, this I can figure out how to make it move. While looking at that at an angle, there's a I need to go down. 

There we go. That well, it's just weird to like move it. And look at it. That's what you. Yeah. So you, you get the idea that like around here are the various shops with Vulcans Hall being kind of the main smithing. This one is, well controlled. Yes, they're kind of around that. 

Yeah, very shops of other carries. Some of them are other way like smoothies. But okay, not that they're bad. But you definitely tell from the dwarfs tone that the other snippities are good. But why sell for good, right? Yeah. Okay. I think I'll thank them for them information and then I pleasure, I often look on metal. 

They have there. Like it dark drawers. They're probably interested in talking about, oh, if you come up here and you can actually see that It's a combination of rather intricately, mined or of various colors and The composition simple, it is. What's around. But between you This stuff. I don't know where he gets it from. 

But old man, doubt it. Atkins hall. He seems that have not just the, the items that he makes from this stuff, but he has the raw material. I don't know where it gets it. He's got some secrets in that old mind, I don't doubt, but Anyway, part of his business is he will keep some of this. 

This is good quality stuff. I haven't been mining for a while now, as I've had a transitioned into a bit more than middle, man, if you get my drift, but he'll keep a percentage of it for his own craft, but then he distributes it to others, to others myths, all over, Thalia Pictures. 

He seems to be one of us and a secretive with his own designs, but is very generous with the tools to make them. Is kind of a helium. Oh. Interested. But yeah, this stuff is headed to miss midras. And between you and me, you didn't see it. You catch my drift and like that covering it and at like as he used, he says that you see his, he like, kind of pulls out like a rather gnarly looking dagger like very briefly and not in like Say anything. 

I'm a slit your throat right here, but definitely like a playful. Like I'm just doing business and I'm trying to be careful with very valuable assets and like just kind of sheets it. That's what we were actually process of doing when Yet you stopped up. So I hope you understand. 

I'm gonna go ahead and do solid imaging cover it with something like a tart. Just until you. Much appreciated voice. Hurry up. We're on a deadline, something around Get the rest of it in the car and make sure all the preparations are done. I want to be out in the hour. 

The you what? You see, literally see the other two, the humans who just kind of standing there. All the two people talking immediately go around. Yeah, no, it was too. Humans immediately go about like, currently picking up stuff. One of them specifically, like, pulls up this large, like seems to be a very large box crate of just like really dense wood, right? 

And you watch us, he like puts it on top of your image on top of it or right. But it seems to like not rest on top it like fits down, like it's clearly some kind of chicanery that has been used before, right? Anyway, yeah, I'll leave him to it, I'll, you know, relate to them, you know? 

Down. I think we might have passed already but there's very popular MIDI components for free to get custom buttons. Some others down below, that may have. Pretty. That makes sense and we gotta get the potions before. Yeah, it might be. Yeah, the works seem interesting. Yep. So I'll go ahead and read it for that way. 

All right, your make your way back towards the section and you can see that They're all like all of their different shops kind of have their own signs and kind of various ways to catch the attention Vulcans. Hall is not. It has if anything it looks like it has like one of those wet floor signs just like stuck out the front door. 

That's right. And that's like seems to be the only indication outside of the design of the building. Is clearly not like the others, right? And as for you, you would recognize this as a Smithy job. Yeah. That this is a building design for this kind of thing, right? Okay. 

But outside of that it just like a little itty bitty like wet floor, sign shape size that just says Vulcans fall. All right. Okay, yeah. So just welcome. Paul. He's the or distributors sleeping. Any interesting going in looking since. Talk about, okay. Might have some things made of it. 

So yep. Okay. Well, I'll go ahead and try to go in. All right, you walk in and immediately the three of you. Well, the two of you. Yeah. Well, you can tell that there's yes. There is a immediate temperature change, right? It's always using your, it's a nice summer day, but it's kind of, like, in the low 70s with a nice cool breeze that has been going. 

You, you walk inside the temperature, immediately ratchets up like 10 degrees, it must there is definitely some, like, smoke that is being redirected up. And inside immediately, you see, various weapons, lighting the wall, you see a very old looking wharf, long gray hair of away from you that that you literally just hear them. 

To. 

So I think what I would probably do is probably know not to interrupt him when he's in the middle of hammering on it. So I'm gonna look at the weapons around it while he finishes the piece, okay? He's probably seen. I'm gonna just continue watching him. Okay, making investigation, check make perception. 

Check Can I help them since I'm? Yeah, the truth. 17 17 are, it's an interesting style of smithing gallop. It's not one that you've seen, you've seen your creator do a little bit of smithing. This individual world is much better. And it's there's at first it seems like there's no rhythm to it because it's like a blow five rapid belows, two blows three rapid blows. 

But there is a pattern to it. It's just an a long and complex pet that it takes you about a minute to finally kind of icing and there is a rhythm to it. Minus a 9 9. 22, 22. Okay, you're looking at these Balfour and there's a bunch of them. 

They're sore. That's its hammers. A couple of things that look to look almost like a metal tube. Don't know. These 

All right. These are very well crafted swords very well crafted. Axes very well. Crafted hammers, make a general history. Check 

11 11. You think you've heard something call the musket? Is that what? That is? The long cylindrical? Yeah, she's Ball. Yeah, that's it looks like I'm you've heard of a musket, you're not really fully sure what it is. But, you know, the general description of it, it kind of looks like that. 

This one looks a little bigger. Not there. You do see? For like metal and wood that are a little bit more. Intricate mechanically speaking than what assault is. Yeah. Okay. 

Our admired, a couple moments go by before you. You finally hear. What? 

And immediately, the room feels up with steam, 

Bitch. And you watch as this works spins around throws the sword and it spins perfectly. And then just clatters onto them. Wow. I was kind of hoping it was gone like perfectly rotating. Can't seem perfectly and impales malfor. This role as he was trying to. And I believe, Eight for the record Kelly. 

It does with past you you're close enough that it does with past you. He's gonna lose, he kind of, it's gonna stretch is a bit pops his back. You can tell, this is a old floor, long gray beard, long gray hair, blah has a monocled and one eye that well over one eye, I think. 

So, with kind of like a chain that seems to be connected to like an earring, very muscular not wearing a shirt, but has like workers pants and shoes relatively scarred on his chest and back from what you've seen. 

Customers. 

I will walk up if anyone else is walking. I mean yeah, close this already but her name stopped him and it clarified it right back. Oh yeah, would definitely when he said customers like, Okay. Does he say that common or dwarven isn't common? Okay. Yeah. That. Well. Are you dead? 

Yes. And for the record because I didn't actually hear what did you say, dialing? Okay, Probably changing. 

And that was the day. Chase murdered the iPad. My friend here and for a short brother, right? And we heard the you were the best media around. So we thought we combined see what you have. What you up and down? True. 

Points over to the section. How much are? They depends? Would you take a trade in? Depends, I'll get out my crossbow. I like crossbow. Just So, take a look at it. Kind of, we just as monocle. 

Crap, do you want it? But to take anything for it. 

About three useful pieces from This. Seems matching, but unfortunately that Makes a little less useful. And give you about. 

Generous give you about a silver. Here, I'm gonna take a look over at the short bows. I guess, which one. Simple work. Making investigation, check the simplest cheapest. Looking one I was trying to avoid 300 gold flat. Yeah, 15 15. Oh, there are a number of shortbows, they all they're about five of them. 

By the looks they are side by side. All really well made by the looks of it. They have no kind of sign or any kind of label. Pick up key like the simplest one, and be like, what's the price on this one? Pointing Okay, gentle takes it. Do that. 

Hundred gold. Memorabilia. Okay. Air shop from it becomes a flaming arrow. Doesn't require special arrows, both special of the errors. 

And I've appreciate you telling me about that. Thank you for your time. Don't talk about the word, what I've seen it. You related information right? You saw it. Like we were all in a group there and you said interesting. And say. Not at least saying we saw a little bit about it. 

I just was like colorful, right? Yeah, what the order? Oh yeah. Yeah I would know about that. Okay. I mean I would ask him. Just by chance, where from 

Where's that secret? The secret? I'm sorry that you used to make the weapons. Just or Spray from the ground. Okay, buddy can find it. What I think it's like metal protector. Maybe you think something? Guess it's all not in fairness, right? Because they don't they buy on The various. 

Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Well, actually, there's a middle. They had not only taken the technicals. It's just could not magazine silver. All right, thank you, nickel. Can take a bath. Maybe nothing special. Just boom. Okay. Oh boy. Found Nick, or Then obviously they have the technical soil. 

Yeah. So yeah, they do say it doesn't have to be fair. Immediately starts, like metal, not asking, can't be magnetic. Just immediately such like looking at your joints testing like oh. So those are most teachers. Yeah, listen to me, suppose them like looking at like a car. And if he's not asking, he's not saying anything. 

How he's just immediately like inspecting now. He's not these not particularly minding. Not that. Yeah. But not bad. What's at the rest? Give you five goals. And no, and that was how we solved. Like look, six. One of your arms, kind of like, moves it around a little bit and go. 

Reaches into like a like a satchel on the ground pulls out and arm that looks relatively similar to what you have. Except for the fact that there is no hand on the end, it is a cylindrical tube that appears to have like bit of flint sticking out the top a little bit like these. 

He's just kind of like oh no, like sizing it up next year on. Like, thinks about it. 

Have flicks your legs a little bit. 

Puts it back into the bags. 

If you ever want too much, or, Something else to att. 

That was that talent? Got a robo doll. That those are the best attachments. No, dude. It's a hydraulic ramp. So yeah. Sorry. Saws off With walking out reciprocating. So. Oh, Yeah, I like to go towards the other merchant area, okay? 

Between rich now, right? Hey, later. Yeah. All right. And want to merge its. All right, there are various ones and you go into one, the one actually closest to the Vulcan of Vulcans Hall and the person behind it behind the desk, who seemed to be just kind of reading some kind of book by the looks of it kind of finding their own business. 

Up, Welcome up. What can I do for you? I'm looking for a short bow, we have a number of them, they're over there on the rack. I will admit that we have a number of them that are Magically enchanted those will be a bit more pricey but to be fair, nothing super spectacular but probably a bit more useful to somebody. 

Hunt in my line of David say, Please feel free to look around. Do you have them price? Is there prices on them? As you go? There are prices. This time. Introvert is very, There are prices this time. Okay, what other prices? There are a number of regular, shortbows, All of them are priced at about five, gold a piece, Then you get. 

And there are about seven of them, They all look really well. Made a lot of them actually look relatively similar and make to the ones that you saw at bulk. It's all You do see the last three of them. Do have a special tag that has like an M written on it. 

With a little note below it, speak to owner well, speak to proprietary. And they don't have prices listed on it. They do not have prices. Okay, I'll go speak together and just ask but general prices for the magic waves that would depend on which boat. Well, he walks around the desk. 

It should probably done this from the beginning. I apologize for that, he walks over the first one. He picks up kind of is made of like a a very dark brown wood, this has a rather interesting. Enchantment on it. That basically, As per my understanding, as for the person who gave it to me to sell Whoever uses this bow. 

What actually might be easier to demonstrate and you watch as he picks up a river with exactly one arrow in it and he pulls hero out. Strings the bow aims it and there is actually a section now that you look there's like kind of like a semi seating range and he pulls the barrel back. 

He fires Surprisingly, good shot, doesn't get a bullseye but does hit like near the center. Well, that's actually pretty good And you watch as he goes and he pulls a second arrow. Whenever this bow fires and arrow from it, hit replicates the arrow. Therefore it basically supplies an individual with errors. 

So they don't run out of stock. 50% more arrow with every error. That's interesting. So that's kind of a as I was told a easy enchantment and not incredibly powerful but it is convenient for individuals that Don't necessarily have a lot of areas I suppose. So this is our as far as I understand, not much more powerful than I standard bow. 

However, due to this, we priced this at about 15 gold, puts it back on the rack. This one This one, let me think about it. Oh yes, I remember now. Any picks up. A different quiver pulls. This one does have arrows in it. Sticks. Close it back. If you under the command word, And he fires and you hear a word that Makeup. 

Check this. I need Iraq. I Gosh, I read you don't understand. Palette. For some reason, I can't see your languages. I don't know why but it although there it is. You also done understand it now like Of your belt or okay. None of you understand. And you watch as the arrow flies and it hits the top. 

Never mind, it does not hit the target, it hits the wall, and you watch as the wall, like, starts to freeze over. 

This has five charges per day and then the enchantment must. Reset recharge. And then you can use it similar. So this adds is some magical ice to each of the arrows that it finds are due to the fact that this is a bit more powerful of an enchantment. This one is priced at about 35 more. 

Puts it back on. Pulls the last one off. 

It takes a couple steps back from where he was standing pulls out an arrow. This also has a command would and he fires it and he says the command word once again in the language and none of you understand and you watch us the arrow flies off and then there's up. 

Oh, I didn't think that through I will need to target. Just this one has three charges of the fireball spell stored in it, and can be used one, charge per arrow. Or if I understand correctly, you can use all of the charges on a single arrow. It's light, it's like casting it better. 

I apologize. I I myself not the magical practitioner. This is the best I translation due to the rather destructive nature of this one and the power of it. This one is priced much higher. This is currently priced at about a hundred and fifty 

Happy to take the ice arrow and I was wondering if you could give me anything for this one. It's a crossbow light. Let me take a look. We takes a kind of looks it over. Yeah too. So Seems have somewhere, but it looks to be in pretty good condition if you don't mind. 

Yeah, I one of the bolts please. At least want to make sure that it works. Yeah, he does load it and he aims down the range and goes. Oh yeah. Well any fires and a fire spine? Yes, I think that works quite fine. I will give you I will give you a gold for it. 

I probably to be honest, I do apologize, but I am pulling the price down due to the the use of the wedding. So understandable. Quite another table. I'll take the one gold and I'll get the ice bow, very good. I grabbed the bow, walk to the. Yeah, I'll need some arrows. 

I watched to the the desk, and I put the, the crossbow to the side. Okay? So minus the gold, that'll be 34 gold. And I assume that you will be purchasing some arrows as well, very good. However, many that you want. How much are they per? I guess 20 I think usually a gold per quiver. 

I think yeah. How much is an equator 20? Yeah. So we do have several quizzes up, it's a gold per quiver. I'm gonna go and then the quiver, very good. Thank you for your business. Thank you. Do you have any potions of healing? Hold that thought? You're good. So Emily when you roll with the iSero. 

If you're using a charge of the ice, you will add an additional D8 iced because that's the random guy that I grabbed out of my destroy. Cool. All right. I mean that's so it's the standard, oh damage. And then if you're using one of the five, ice charges and additional date, okay, you got it and I should say, yeah, yeah. 

Okay, I'll ask him if he knows. Anyone who sells health potions or I think you'll need to go to the apothecary. He's right down the street. I won't deny that I don't know how much his supply is recently, the military and the gods came purchasing a lot of things. 

Surprisingly enough, that's actually when I got started with the last year. Oh, Hmm. Okay. Anyway, but yes, you, you could check with him. He might. Unfortunately, I am not a prevaire of potions, but I believe if he has any stock, he'll be more than happy to sell. Then I was like, thank you. 

My pleasure. Thank you for your patronage. And that he looks at you talent and just goes What? And hello. Crazy, does he's with us? He okay. Yes. Good day. 

And I make them a heat. I didn't like that statement. Anyway so make your way out. Yeah. If the way you said it, I know. But the way you said it made me think try again. Okay. You make your way over to the apothecary. You open up and you immediately are a costed with the smell of like mixing thing like when you walk into like like a chem lab and you just smell like chemicals and stuff like that. 

That's what this place smells like. It to expected. And they they're currently doesn't seem to be anybody in the store. There are like glass files, empty, less files of sections with some that have liquid in them. And there appears to be like a little, you know, bring the bell thing on The name one moment. 

Hold on. Don't I got it. I got it. I got it. Oh. 

There's immediately a flood of smoke coming from like a background and you see, Really. You see actually a very short about three foot tall. No, come out big like Like bimble science goggles on his face covered in like black soil or something like, they're completely covered in some kind of substance, as he's just gonna Well, that didn't work. 

All right, I'm gonna have to make another that those two things. Whoop, do not mix and as he pulls the goggles off his entire face is covered with it. Except like right? Yeah. Good morning or afternoon or good evening. Are you okay? Not fine. Yep. And I have some all-purpose space off. 

What can I do for you? Well, that's a silly question. You're in my shop. So you're probably here to buy something. That comes in a flask. Why didn't I say it like that? Welcome to my shop. I am a prevail of all kinds of potions and chemicals and Hmm, that's still sounds weird. 

I sell a lot of. Nevermind. We do have a couple of them still in stock, you're lucky. I just whipped up the last couple of them, I'm running out of supplies for that stuff. How many are you looking for any particular kind of power to them? Pretty good power. 

Okay? Use of power. How much do they call? That depends. He walks into the back room. Oh boy, I got open up window. It's like, You hear like a like a tank tank and then he comes back. So Opens up a window. The industrial revolution starts. You do actually like here like out like a creaking. 

Oh okay, that's blow that out the window. I hope nobody's paying attention to that. No, this smoke is not coming from my establishment, everything is perfectly fine. Oh shit. Now it's coming up later. Anyway I do apologize on. Fortunately I only have two ready. These are as powerful as I have, they are. 

And he sets to relatively large. They're actually larger than the ones that you have flags. Not like well the ones that you have like that. This is almost kind of like that. This are two greater healing potions, they're pretty fortuitous. Okay, they do better. I do apologize. I I had a couple of superiors but they take a long time to prepare and unfortunately the dharmi needs them before you random strangers. 

Yeah. Understand which in fact, they should probably get before you random strangers. Anyway, I'm not gonna think about that too hard. How much are they? Oh, yes. Usually a hundred. Thank you. Thank you. These got about a hundred a piece. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, because the standard ones, 50 standards soup. 

There's nothing greater than beyond that. It's whatever, higher pricing. Depending on what it does. I think it's a hundred for greater. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. That's right. Thank you for letting me see it though. Um, You know, we are always open for trade and people got materials interesting. Things that they don't need is corals but they couldn't certain things, you know. 

They're always interesting. If you throw it in a flask or heat it up and see what happens. I'll keep that in mind. Thank you very much. No, do not. Tell the gnome that you're going to give him your rope. It has many features especially don't ask for profusely experts. 

I need you know, you see it's it's That's what kind of ingredients so to be perfectly honest in the In person's day. It's a lot of plants and birds to be perfectly honest. I'll make a potion, have it just about anything. And that doesn't always mean that it actually makes supposion, but I'm always curious to see well happen if you take something and mix it with something else and put it over a little bit of heat, and boil that shit up and see what happens. 

If somebody's stupid enough to drink it. Merrick would like this stone. I That sounds kind of bad when I say it out loud to be fair. Whatever the hell you usually it's me. She's body. That doesn't make it any better. I have died yet. That's still probably not making it sound better. 

Throughout, it's very true but I can guarantee that everything that I sell does work, even if not intended, Okay. Like that one any points mad like, oh, you didn't think it was actually like full. Mm-hmm. It looks like it's an empty glass. Yeah, and as you look at it, It's almost somehow more opaque than water. 

Hmm. Yeah, that's it. What do you think that would do? Yes, it is actually that Being that clear about first thought would be potentially from someone invisible. That's what I was going for. That is not what it does. Don't know what I'm sure. Tell you die. I literally don't know. 

Like, it decreases your mouth. You don't have to drink it. And that's the scary part about it. I should label that How much is he immediately runs into the back? I can't believe I didn't think about that first. Airplane and he slimes hardly writing on like something. Like he just had like a sample and he was like, okay, tears it off. 

Runs over looks great. Miss yeah, did you do me a favor? Just yeah. He's stick it on there and what you've seen that, he draw, he drew a giant skull. Well he did say it, you shit. Your brains out. So you die. Okay? Metal man. All right, you want this thing. 

How much is it? What do you mean you want something? If you don't mind me asking what you would be? I mean, that's a pretty terrible way for anybody, the guy? Things. Yeah, it's somebody. It's monsters. Oh my gosh. What were that? Oh, no. Throw it on the basilisk. 

Yeah, it was on that day. The refrigerator had turned brown Or backup results. Yeah, if you do report back to me and you use this on some kind of creature and you take some detailed notes as like what happens, I'll cut the price in half. I'll sell you that for about 50 gold. 

Okay, the ocean of shit yourself. No, don't Be it was yeah I don't I asked for a healing potion. You come back with a while, should probably? Point out that it has not been tested on monstrosities. It's been tested on things, the size of large. This is also and smaller. 

So it hasn't been tested on, you know, like something the size of like a giant. Like some of the cyclops is so it's effectiveness might be not as gray, but, you know, it's probably gonna affect them anyway, which just Michael be just as effective. Yeah. You know, oh, I'm hoping that keyword for tonight. 

Yeah, I wouldn't touch you so That's actually an interesting idea. He immediately light one. He starts writing something else out. And here you hear a muttering under his breath, dip, Fault into and shooting the target. What would happen? I did balls it. All right. Anyway, so you're interested in it little man. 

Okay. Okay, I'll get that. One click. I think I'll be fine. Pop, what happens here. Yes. So some questions. Yeah, and his arm roster. All right, I'll get that right now. Someone has a plan though. I can't wait to this. Is my, even though custom item potion, man, could you help? 

I'm gonna be there. I mean, just like puppies. Make, thank you. And you watch like has he supposed to? He's got like he gets about this close to it and seems to be like not paying attention still, he watches. He just kind of and he's got gloves on now even though this is just up. 

Walks over like goes behind the desk. He's completely just like upstairs by the desk and you hear a little There we go. One mile of horrible death. 50 cal shit, the best hustles. Yeah, by the way, by the way, I will point out just between you and me all rights reserved for the naming and marketing of this device this invention because I did, create it, I just haven't thought of a good name for it because I didn't really think it hadn't used for anything. 

Since you people are interested in it, it might have some Horrible, horrible and applicableness to it, which in that case if you actually use this on anybody in the city you didn't get it from me and I will deny everyone. We had no attention, you know? Bright color, bright. 

What God? There are more and you're not there. Thank you very much. I do have a lot of my chemical equipment tomorrow and I do have a lot of my you know, That I used in my action manufacturing, this stuff that stuff isn't usually for sale. I should just immediately lean over. 

Willing to test some of that on that. Yeah. And you're not going to get mad at me if it makes this guys. No kind of died. He just looks something you would betrayed. Calic, you say that you say I can make one. I can make I can immediately make one tomorrow. 

He immediately like reaches in his back pocket and he just as one But yeah, I absolutely love to say this. Oh defender. And he's like, okay, one of those little droppers. Like chemistry. Yeah. And as he hands it to, he's once again going and you're not gonna hold it against me and you're not gonna flamers, you're not gonna be mad at me and you're not gonna wreck my shop and you're not gonna take it out on me, he's not responding to my own curiosity too. 

All right, great. That's right. Okay. Say curiosity. So he like immediately here in like the same little step ladder. Immediately around his ass. As soon as like something goes wrong, like, if I'm immune Would like us. I'll just drop some. Oh, it's it's smacked. It's splashes on both of. 

You entirely television. So You take out the dropper I run and you see this car. He's like Like standing behind the desk like still primarily behind it just in case but like you see just you basically see You basically see this from behind the desk. Now oh boy, just the biggest smile. 

Just It's super excited. Eyes. Waiting to see what happens. How many drops do you put on your still defending three? Okay, that was one. You put three drops on your steel defender and As like each droplet hits, you're still defender. And then just slowly slide off its back and then onto the ground. 

Oh, the floor. Start shaving. So yeah. A bunch of nuts and bolts. 

So please now you actually watch like the three droplets are now like, on the ground and it's like, they haven't done anything. It's not like they haven't evaporated. They haven't like seemed to spread out. It's almost like they landed on a non-organic surface, and then kind of almost like congealed. 

Yeah. Almost like a jet like a small droplet of jello two degree shit. It's still like a liquid, but it's not acting like a liquid should. And it and he just kind of looks at you and goes into resting. Interesting, interesting, he runs into the back of any of your And he runs it back and is holding a mouse in his hand, okay? 

So Just out of curiosity. So I I think you can. Wait, he has gotten to this point where he's almost dropped the mouse like in front of the little droplets and he looks at my house and knows what's wrong. That's a word. We on the might be leaving soon. 

Carry on. Okay, put some mouse down. And mouse looks at him, and he kind of The houses intelligent. The mouse walks over. Each and like the mouse puts like a paw into one of the puddles and immediately like the it's almost like she's the liquid just like sucks into the mouse's. 

Paw nothing happens. Doesn't to the other two. 

All right, good to know. Good to know, magical creatures on effective, but it does absorb. Okay, interesting. Thank you. That was really good to know. I'm super nice. And you like reaches out, it's handing them out, like, grandpa's back up and like sits on a shoulder. That's really good enough. 

It's like a real mission. So if here's that, that does not affect what appears to be a does not absorb into non-organic beings and magical beings are unaffected by, but it doesn't absorb it. That's good to know. Thank you for that. I'm interested in. Anything else? Anything else that you would like to passed? 

You're very willing. Let me rephrase that. Curious, I don't have a way to rephrase that we understand. Yes, I hope that I didn't come off as nearly as creepy and weird as I normally do. But probably didn't know. Let me rephrase that. I hope that I'm not as off-putting as people say. 

I Not nearly enough. But what does work I like you. That's great metal man, that I don't still don't know how you exist, but All kinds. Anything else I can help you with? No, both we find anything interesting. You might bring it back to using the experiment. What? I'll incentivize the deal if you bring back notes on what that does to larger creatures and monsters and stuff I will. 

I will drop the price of the grade of healing potions. Cut it down. I've got. Kind of figure that out when you talk 30%, you seem to go from like really excited to like, I don't need a job. Yeah, wait a minute. They yeah, we'll talk about it when you get back with them. 

Thank you, Have a good day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Interesting. For me. I'm down here. Yeah, do you say that like as you're leaving to him? As you say that you just go you'll be dead. Yeah, we got a person shits himself to death instantly and if I'm going down, I'm taking you right here. 

All right, terrifying. Hair. Fine. It's one. It's some point bad. How comes the helios? So, if I end up dead due to very mysterious and shitty circumstances, okay, the revenge for me, get revenge for me. You come everyone's like, hey guys, did you get out the I got better. 

Yeah, Mercy. Oh just you find me a healing potions like drink? Yeah. Sleep. What's the exact opposite of a healing person? Not all, here's the dead, It's not the exact opposite. It's not, It's forwards fart words. I don't want it, if it breaks see that they come out. I'm getting away and we're just That I can see exactly where this is going. 

May Lake creature. Poison, I'm right next to it. I'm gonna throw the push, and Oh no, you're like magically. We need to find the same. Still a human magic and it's a fun word centers or drinking there, water or alcohol or what I have. You know. Boy, they're all dead.

Hello relatively opportunity, right? This is the apartment, right? Yeah, they were down here. Yeah. So we probably. Yes, right here. 

Yeah, eventually mute output. You see each other. And that's where we will pick up next. You have to say it that way. Shit? Right down. You don't have one potion of a shitty death. Oh yes, immediately makes me think there is somewhere over vagina. Yeah. Have you planned cyberpunk? 

Oh boy.
