Better go early evening. Edward, It's about this time that the both of you actually make perception a minute. That. 

If you want. Okay, I can't help you yet. You what? Oh, wow, chirping in a D&D game. But you are a little distracted by the whole situation per diem. I didn't Ira, you do hear the fake sound of And the grinding of wooden wheels and turning back your eyes, much more accustomed to this time of Day night, you see? 

Not the most peculiar thing, but it's still not exactly the most common of things. You see a night care, man. Several cards laden back. You see? The lead cart has the lanterns out as they normally do. You see an older gentleman, you know, kind of long, white beard, long white hair, raining the horses, you do, see the customary, what appears to be like a scout, you know, kind of woodsman clothing, longbow, scrapped over their back standing, how to keeping an eye, but not really imposing any kind of threatening No And they slowed the caravan slowly gets closer from closer. 

And eventually, as they take notice of two individuals, one relatively large individual in particular standing by the side of the road, you hear. Whoa. If you kind of takes off the small little suck, like the kind of sun hat that he that he has on his head. Still Good evening travelers. 

Don't see many people this far out of the roasts on the road. It is a lovely evening, though. It is well met good sir. Indeed the moon shines upon as well. He says that he does a gentleman. A good night to be helped, riding delivering our ways. After all. 

Everybody. So superstitious about traveling at night, the land sees, what? Better time to make travel easy and cool, especially as far as we have to go. The town of Frost is not that far, but It is not an easy journey. So if it will be worthwhile as we are able to stop by in nearby town and partake, even Good story and a good ale at the vintage as we pass, by Would that be the sour vintage? 

Of course my good lady. We are heading west. No, I'm looking at the wrong person. We are heading east to several places for the beyond there but we always stopping the town and few be perfectly honest. This elevated is well known in that area and a good place for a story and a song and a good dream. 

So we will, of course be stopping there for a brief one. Just like, is there a reason my idea? A help for two is we were going there ourselves on foot trying to That's no way to travel. It'll take you days to do that. Perhaps to join your caravan. 

Yeah of course I see no reason not to Simon. If you would in the hunts the hunter seems to stand out, get down walks over and he is pretty cloaked even at night, seeming to concealed his features. And as he gets closer, you see him pull out a 

Yep, you see him pull out a What appears to be a chain necklace at the at the end appears to be a pendant that depicts a silver dragon with a golden. 

Kadin having grown up in nitros, you know, immediately. What this is? This is a symbol of the goddess of the dawn metrics. Widely worshiped and prays through the city of the hero of deity that saved the city during the war with the What was the simulator but it is a silver dragon with a golden knot. 

You recognize this immediate. Iraq, you recognize it, vaguely. Have you seen some of the nearby where you were staying? Some of the towns people had something similar but nothing quite as Nights looking shall we say? You hear him mutter something under his breath, and he looks at the both of you and for a brief moment, you watch his, the kind of Shade face the eye seemed to glow golden very briefly and immediately didn't. 

He gets a knot to the two of you. I see no problem here. And he walks back up hops back on. Well it's Simon says it's all right. Then absolutely hop aboard. Just so you know, our caravans are non-stop, we will be traveling during the day and at night for those of you that have since you have been traveling at night and you want to get some sleep during the day, don't worry these tops are designed to provide as much shade and shelter both from the sun for those that need to rest from the elements. 

You are most generous by friend. I will repay you if I can. Do you have anything you need? No need no need. It is good to offer a to those that find themselves on the road, that is beautiful. I will play you songs. If that's okay. On the way, who doesn't I do? 

Enjoy me a good traveling song as peaceful as it is at night. People don't like to sing there. Got now, less than addition. Whoa. I will, I'm sorry, I meant to say master musician, Like I just received it. Yeah, he said, I meant to say master musician, I will go and as I walked off, I would say, I didn't you. 

You can call me out collab and I also introduce myself to a handshake. My name is Ira. On the Lord. Here and the caravan starts off today. You ride through the night. And through the next day, the care map is even though it looks like it would be a slow thing. 

It is free evenly. Paste. And so, you could even, you would have to exert a considerable amount of effort to make pace like Something you're not exactly used. Iraq. It's perhaps a little bit slower than if you were going full board, but it keeps you from having to, you know, Several days. 

Travel go back. A day's travel goes by for Leos and Balfours. You eventually, see a change in the setting, what was once kind of grassy greens with forests around and some mountains in the distance? You start to see what appears to be a section of beach. You can see the ocean, you see, nice pristine light sands and you see a village a small bit, but a village nonetheless in the distance. 

With one building set a little bit almost outside of the immediate village. That is a little bit larger than all of the other buildings with a very large sign of fixed to the top of it. It's a little far unless you want to strain to see. No, need to you continue on your way number of hours. 

Go by And I would like the both of you to make the perception. 

Should have stuck with the other guys. What? 17 17. You both hear what sounds like a weird. Almost cracking sound. Yeah, Helio Helios. It's it throws you off a little bit. You kind of can quite figure out where it's coming from. Exactly but Balfour, new immediately Not only here the sound but you identify that it's coming from the beach not that far away from where the two of you are about to almost walk past perfectly here, Right? 

And it's weird because you see what almost seems to be. Like, jagged line, just floated. And then as you watch and you hear the cracking sound in a flash that you kind of have to spin by this point in time, helios. You've seen it as well. But, you know, it's like dumbass it's over. 

There's a free flash and you both kind of blink real quick like and the odd almost jagged crack in the air is gone. Instead, you see something a little odd. You see what appears to be a four-foot mat? Holding a chain on a small connected to, what seems to be a small? 

Redstone The stone seems to be out in front of him, like all my chain holding the chain out front of him and then it goes left. The wraps the chain back up with the little gem, puts it back in this pocket and starts to walk. Seemingly judging, you know, using angles and guesstimation relatively similar to door destination. 

The town. That's supposedly houses, the solvent. 

Okay, they do that. Yeah, I assume not that I'm super but I assume that that is a relatively uncommon occurrence. 14, 14. You would not be at your strong suit but having grown up and heard many, many stories. You know though you don't really know how it works that your land of is. 

Somehow oddly separated from the larger world. People seem to appear or so. But they do and they almost always seem to be from shipwrecks, that somehow got. And people have talked about getting caught in a terrible storm, that seemed to appear out of nowhere, and then finding themselves washed the shore. 

These people are not super fun but it's not unheard of However, somebody just seeming to appear out of nowhere. That is off. That is unusual to you and you can't think of any stories and something like that out of maybe the rarest trace of somebody possibly miss talking about the day. 

The dragonlords appear are they seem to appear out of nowhere? But those stories have been told it's so many different ways from so many different perspectives. That's the closest. But that's, that's to ages long ago. That's to almost make at this point. Hmm, but this is definitely a strange occurrence. 

Adam did. I've never seen a man just The beer. Can't say, I've even heard of it. Never seen it before. Hmm. But, Once like he's going our way. So we may end up talking to him anyway. So as we share, Without walking. Yeah, I presume like he's like we're not like To where we would be like awkwardly walking next to each other, right? 

No. Based on the current angle it judging by the his position and your position. And the fact that as you two start walking, you are noticeably catching up. Like it's kind of like this where you're both moving and you will eventually converge and most likely overtake him. And as you can tell that he is a shorter though, right? 

And just by nature of size, your stride is longer and you are catching up, okay? Yeah. About saying an hour, hour and a half, go by. And now, you're definitely catching up, and you can definitely tell. You, can definitely see this individual There. Sir. So she appeared in this land and seen the town that your charm indicated and you started walking you finally left the beach. 

It definitely look a lot smaller and when you first arrived but man, you had to walk. Why don't? And you finally find a trail and it's going in the direction of the town in the direction that your charm, indicated, Any keep walking and I would say that make perception change. 

We'll see how perceptive market. Not starting off. Great. Yeah. Well actually no I shouldn't have had you passed. A passive perception is 11 a lot. So, Being drawn as you always are from one adventure to another, you're not paying the most attention, but you do definitely hear the footsteps of other travelers behind you. 

That, you know, you're not exactly the quickest of individual on your shorter legs and you're used to some of the big people as you travel around walking, catching up to you and walking past you. Yeah, on the road. So, this is not a new occurrence and you turn around. 

And you see two individuals, one that appears to be eleven, what appears to be human of some kind of relatively large, and they do seem to be catching up to It's a little bit different attire than you're used to. Especially the human, you know, you've seen. Chainmail. Yeah. Probably made out of bronze though. 

Weird. Yeah, the weirdest thing you've seen but How do you do? I'm Eric Alarus I assume that means for women policy. Yeah. You I assume American kind of stopping. Wait, yeah. Okay you stopping wait. Stop 10 minutes go by and they eventually catch up to where you are. 

And interesting magic. You did that? Teleport, you know, I don't really know. I think that's what I was trying to do. Here prime to do that. 

Eric O'Reilly writer of the wins. You get? Yes, that's a great description. Actually, I just kind of go wherever destiny takes me. Butter of the Wednesdays. I'm called Helios nice to meet you envelope here. Yeah. For because as for review it's standing about four feet tall marek has a round habit like face, he has a large nose with puffy lips, dark brown eyes with cinged. 

Eyebrows is naturally balls, balled and yeah, he wears perfectly pressed tweed clothing. 

To me. They say I'm just going where the winds take me is that's where you're going. Well. About and I did have a destination in mind. Well, help me better government of the winds. Do you like drink? Oh, I could drink at the tavern man. I'll never refuse a good time. 

And this file about them and just kind of going through, nice to meet you about door. I will say for point of reference Balfour, and Helios the happening that is talking to you. Is that sense a little spring? Imagine, you know, really remember hearing one like it. I mean, nothing can be other than the fact that it's just a paired out of minutes. 

So I'm just throwing up here as well. Okay, sure. All right, so the three of you start. Once again, congrat, making your way closer and closer. Anything you would like to do or say? 

Can't really think of anything at the moment not yet, but we can put a slight pain in this, right? Iraq. And today. It's been about the days that you've been with the caravan and these are a pretty jovial bunch of merchants. They take very quickly to the both of you. 

Yeah, though, they didn't seem to have a particular soft spot for cadene is musical power as any day that they day or night, that they stopped to break seems to immediately pop up into some kind of apart where they're singing dancing and all kinds of things. More than once Ira, you have been asked for your hand today by many of the individuals who are special, when you say no, but they always often both the men and women. 

But you're making very good time and on the 30th day of this paradigm, Morning comes and you hear me. Ah, there we are. We've made even better time than we normally do. We're coming into view right now. I see the ice cream is the town with salad. Yes, that is what he is referring. 

Was all about it. You don't know, but he didn't say he didn't say the name of the town. He just said that they were going to stop there as they asked to go onto their actual destination. I will ask them when. Where will that be? Where would love be could eat? 

You say we are here. I said that we're almost here. Give us another Simon about how far. That is per case gives us about another. To three hours. And will be at the. Unless something. Comes out of nowhere. Makes things difficult, always such a worry. What you Talking about things coming out of nowhere. 

Yes, yes. I know. Have a lot of work, Something that you both have picked up that between the two of them believe. Merchant seems to be a very cheery disposition and not really one to worry about the details, where this huntsman slash guards been, perhaps simon seems to be The voice of reason, splash the voice of paranoia. 

Sometimes it's a little of each their moments where stuff like, no, he's definitely the reasonable one. Yeah, then there are times that it's like you're just glue. Oh, you're just trying to call something, right? Yeah, but Well, there you have it About three hours and we'll be able to Here, another story and hear a different kind of song. 

Not that I mind. Your music has been wonderful fitting. I kind of wait to see. What is offers as well? Wide, variety, as I'm told, but some of that is for the younger crowd. I'll show you understand, any kind of elbows. You have cadine indeed. Why? Like, wings 

Lie to DM, didn't hear that. But what did you say? He's making himself even older. I just I said my life wings was at the selfie sometimes. Oh please a theme. You're only half the age that I am. You have a number of years before? Are you okay? And besides that sure a number of he kind of like winks a number working women. 

He absolutely. Please tell have someone is counted as huge. I'm gonna be like Smoking for many, you say that his face immediately it goes I apologize. I would never That is. I was like, And you just kind of clamps up a little bit and it was like thinking 

I'm gonna I'm gonna laugh like, and you hurry up. I'm going to nap a couple hours ago by good evening Island and you here. Well you don't hear. Good dean where would you be sitting? Would you be sitting up on the front or at the front still kind of a little awkward not from your perspective but a little awkward from the the driver Well. 

Once again, something you don't see every day, people just traveling the road on foot. You see three individuals not that far in front of you too tall. And one very short, perhaps a family behavior child. Oh boy, I don't think that's it. I know it's Well, I was napping. 

You're right. And difficult. Well that's right. There could be it's something far out of town for a family to go to that one. What they supposed to reach their own will be able to wait and say hello and the caravan rapidly starts catching up as these three are just walking the three of you. 

Very clearly start to hear the clump in the foot of foot at homes, who loves the clamping of hooks and the rolling of wheels around. And you do see what appears to be a three wagon chain character. And you turn back and you see and older man looks to be a very athletic 80s by by his appearance. 

His long, white beard and but a very energetic looking individual who has kind of a light straw sun hat. That is like, takes his hands off the rains and actually weighs good morning. Hello, any kind of oh, I think you were wrong. I don't think this is a family with a child. 

At least. It's definitely about a family, a child I've ever. It's a marriage. Marriage, full read here? No, no. The youngest one appears to be. Suppose he's You don't bad day. As by mistake I did from far away. You look like you could have been my family out for a lovely job. 

Oh, how do you do? I'm just really short of the forest. I just had turned back at the beach, I meant to say, road the beach. You've been in the camera just came back for two longer pooped up in this wagon. You look, wait, the last of all lookout in the stores. 

How many days has it been? No. Later old. Mmm. Do we calculate it? It has been a number of days since we've been traveling we did pass the whole side by I think I've browned out, but you know what I mean? Okay, guys, I don't exactly Are you folks put your unsetted to place that contains the sour rigids? 

Kids, I don't know. Are we seems to be an old two common gathering police these days? Is it? Yes. Yes, indeed sounds. Good to me. I'm just looking for an adventure. I'm not sure you'll find it without just going through a timer. I'm napping. I'm having a great day. 

You know, I've never been to this Tavern, but you can find adventure plenty of tab. Well, Jonathan, if you What I think the gentleman is attending the same as this relatively tall, wanky looking still very cloaked, almost like hunter, ranger ideas to be dark colors darkens, these blood, what I believe, The head is trying to say. 

It is still a bit of a distance. And should you be so proud for a bit of Quicker. Transportation is offering free, passage the rest of the way to the. As we have offered to this individual at his sleeping lowlight, Still in cape. It's appreciated. If it's snowing convenience, I'd be greatly appreciated. 

Don't think it'll be an inconvenience but he does step down and he walks towards the three of you and you would see that he seems to reach under his cloak a little bit. Pull out this medallion that has a silver dragon in the golden knife. Once again, balfour, you would immediately recognize this. 

Merry you have no idea what this is help. You would you just like cool? Yeah. Yeah. Haven't you been born and raised here. Good also recognized this as a free again once again, he whispers something under his breath, make a perception and then on our content, well make a projection. 

Check to see if you hear what he says. 12. Yeah, he's not hiding it. Making a comment yet. And get another discount 15 plus. I don't know what it is. Argument is off the top of my head, but it's got to be good. I asked probably 21. Yeah, it's very you immediately recognize what kind of stuff he is. 

In fact, asking his spell. He's casting. Detective goal, I'm got nothing to it. So that's what that casts a little and he looks at each one of you and then come on slowly puts the coin. Well the the medallion back it comes close, you move. Can be not glory. 

Oh yeah, they represent as much trouble as the first. And a steps back up.

Sit, a smile seem to peek out underneath the cloak of cinnamon as he just, it seems to be chuckling at the situation that the very good natured. Merchant seems to always somehow around these new individuals, but his foot in his mouth a little bit. 

Yeah. Let them and away. So once again, you write off Within the hour, you come to a small town and oh The large building down the way. You can't really miss it. There is a sign that. Is they sour vintage the one that The five of you are looking for.

Hmm. Yeah. Okay. So we're all headed to the same place. What are you going there for if I might ask. Okay, so we would see Of one received a letter yet. Power treaty. Hmm, indeed, I've just seemed to have been brought here by destiny. May helps. Oh yes. Here he is. 

The writer of the The appeared out in the thin air on the beach as a bath or an eye were making our way. It's quite impressive here. Wonderful. The snap crackle into pop there. He was I love the delays. General general knows humor or characteristic. What the heck? Four. 

All right, there's no. What Our child's a little different. That's about as far as that thought yet. Anyway. If I might ask, What was the contents of the Liber? Just to go to the end as we see the water. Oh, that's crazy. I was, that was open nose and open form question color, much like him. 

Sorry, that was me. Oh, I was guided because I'm sorry. So we have two guided by the mysterious hands of destiny. Hmm. And two simple letters and some letters. And Destiny. Essay what, what is the nature of your destiny? I was talking about you and I'm sorry about that. 

Oh, I see. Well, how about yourself then? I feel like I just said that, but There we have original. Yeah, I got letter. Oh yeah. What was the compensating? Just something me to the doorful. Okay. This this I received this from a serious woman with Donald. Who appeared office. 

So, I'm going to say, hey yes, a long blonde hair, blue eyes, wearing kind of like like your stereo should go like toga dress type deal with a satchel that was just seeming to be overflowing with like scrolls but never actually spilling out. She was a whirlwind, she seemed to before the two places that once but she gave me a letter. 

So here. Is that the same for you? Did you pull out? You did this and you pull it. It's like pull out the spreading on it. I'm glad it's for okay, you pull me down? I would say Helios and Ira you do see on the old scroll, a symbol that looks very familiar because it's in the letter for each of you as well. 

You do immediately recognize it as the symbol of miracle videos because it is the same. I write. You see that? It's the same as the one in your order like I will definitely point I'll put that out. I'll be like that's that's the same symbol I got now. Pull mine on back symbol. 

The topic is. Well. Not sure if plot is the right word. We are all in a story. I think that, you know, I'm just happy to be here, not alone. But the nature of the But what did they say? Maybe that's not the top of this industry. We should probably get you know the sun is beating down which if I get to the, you know. 

Well yes. It's a glorious day. Why wouldn't be not stand outside? I must be if this is to oh boy I started doing your voice. Brain doesn't work. Another one. Well, if this is your supposed to be your destiny, there's there shouldn't be any shame in it. It? I thought it was your destiny. 

Is it letter? Or is it destiny? Suppose. It could be both. That's really what I would think you neither. Mac, but I'm not ashamed of yes. What? I recognize the symbol in there. Yes, you absolutely. Oh yes, you absolutely do that. While you don't have a letter. Right. We've got where, where you grow up? 

Use automatically recognize 

Perhaps we should continue. Agreed. I did hear there was a good tavern around here. Yes, that is the place where we're going the sour vintage. Oh excellent. I could go for a pint of veil. It reminds me a home. Both wine here, right? I mean, I assume there were probably I don't think we expect them. 

I mean, yeah, a lot of wine. I'm sure. But I don't see why there wouldn't be this idea. But 

Having lived here, all your life could be, you know, that there are a myriad of wines a myriad of ales, a recent dwarf, took it upon himself to try and brew something different and it hasn't gone. A lot of traction, but you have heard of something called beer. Yeah. 

Beyond, you know, that too. He's throwing me off right now. What kind of spelling. Yeah. Okay, here. Don't we? See what they're for. Absolutely. I was going to keep distance from people, though, if you go at least, like five foot away from people at all times. So you all start walking towards the tablet. 

Yeah, you all do notice that in the kind of monthly group of five that you are. That IRA seems to distance yourself a little bit behind everybody else. All right, we're gonna put a pin. 

Race. You never gave me your character's name? No. Nope. All right. Sorry. And he's not indeed beyond whatever got a finger involved. It's the same one. Yeah. 

Okay, so let's start with, you can just tell me what your favorite chance. Here. Just to make sure I'm saying what's right? Yeah. 

Oh yeah. You wake up. I'm sorry. You're familiar one. It's the room that you were in last night. But your creator isn't there, they're gone. That worries. After all, a lot of us happen recently. Lot is. Here you recognize, this is the room of a tablet thing. You and he recently stopped it late last night. 

The sour vintage. Remember about the town. 

But I must still defend the radon. Root up to. You know, what? Where is it, where's the creative? Now, this was the question that I asked. Do you want me to play root on? Or do you want? Oh, Fun. I think. Okay, although he can't like I don't think you can generally speak, I'm just gotta. 

Yeah, hand gestures and like what kind of adjusters and if you feel like it likes, it's not specifically in there, but like for the purposes of conversations, The one commit cork the mentioned to you that? I'm not testing. I think. Yeah, he looks at you and 

As you brought. These a basically looks like without you from. He was like the chameleon from another one for the wild. To explore whether Any to look up a picture because I don't know what you're discerning to me. Yeah, volcano one. Unless you don't remember the time themselves a while. 

Yeah. Oh, the lizard thing. Yeah. Yeah, it was a familiar, dude. Okay, let me actually get it better. Look at that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well then it still doesn't relatively symbolic thing. It kind of sits on its back legs and kind of gets you this, Yeah, and then leaves back down and then like, walks over to the door and like just kind of points like racism. 

It's front leg and just like points out the door. That's right. 

Oh, what's happens? We'll go into the The markers downstairs. Yeah, you want downstairs and this little relatively early morning, probably 9, 10 o'clock. And there are people bustling about you, see the proprietor behind the bar, cleaning up. You see a couple of familiar looking hunter they got like first skins and like the bows not like resting beside them, they seem to be eating kind of an early morning or well, late morning breakfast and talking and you see a woman Long blonde hair, bright blue eyes, kind of a toga robe. 

She seems to be writing on a scroll and mothering to herself. And as you walk down, stairs, down the stairs. She immediately without looking up, guys. And, I was wondering if it was going to be the first one to show up. I should have known you after all, you did arrive last night. 

Appropriate. And the circumstances by what? Please, we need to have a conversation. 

It looks better about it, immediately is just like, 

And like, Cox has you? I'm not going to buy this and believe it or not. I Might have some answers that you're looking for. And don't take yourself. We both know, you're looking for friends. The guy stay off to the side. You walk over and you get yours, please.

Let's say probably me. You open the doors Balthazar inside. You see? A relatively large, nice tavern pleasantly populated with a couple of individuals talking about an older woman, who seems to be the proprietary cleaning dishes, and having said, general side conversation with what looked to be too hunters off to the side. 

You also see a long, a haul blonde, haired woman, long, blonde hair. Blue eyes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, talking too. Hey, How's she? She looks to be about six foot. A even taller more forge. What the position I'm sitting, I have, I will put on when they always see, no, it would be, they would see your back. 

Okay, so they won't even realize that I figure out if they So I mean it's like it's all your like your arms covered too arms and hands covered some, what they don't look kind of like, I think just kind of like this. Most, the arms are covered but not all the way down. 

So when I just see a very tall, Even taller than the woman. Person. Human way. Good kind of humanoid, right? You know. If you sit in, and you also see, Some kind of four-legged creature with a tail signal to the side. Simple goes, literally made a method. Yeah. Okay. 

Right. And as you enter Belfast looking at old. Yeah. This weird almost reptilian metallic thing. Just seems to be looking directly at you later. And as you enter, you kind of hear the woman go now over here. Yeah. Yes, you I know this is strange, but you were sent here for a reason. 

Yes, I know why. Mmm days. Come in. And those that are with you. Yeah. And upgrade your afternoon lady or whatever time of day, it is afternoon. Hello again. Hello. I don't I get your name okay, we'll get to that. Introductions are about And you all walk over and the table is set for six.

A terrifying, giant form has been laying waste to the heartlands slaughtering everything in its pain is bore, unfortunately has been corrupted by the titans and sent to punish the mortals of Thailia for their continued faith in the five deities. 

Many of attempted to hunt this poor. Dollar effect. Leading to the Expected result. If you wish to wait win, Phantom Fortune as great heroes, should Then you must prove to the people of Thibodya that you are warriors. That the Oracles prophecy is about this while for an offer to the gods as a sacrifice. 

Now that we have the formalities out of the way, are there any questions? Anything to be worried about what this bore. It's dangerous is powerful, and it is being Means amplified specifically by 

But of course, everybody knows about city. Eric the outside, dude. 

Drawn is yeah. Right. Very convincing. 

That tighten up, and she looks at you with this. Here lives will probably know this I met. Doesn't you look everybody? That is born here. Would know that he is. And just make sure I get this right here, beautiful, big yolos, Half powerful, or sorry, I'm about to get the names of the eventually Kadim and Kelly, you would all know that Sidron is called the Lord of Skills. 

All right. Social returns to you and look the Lord of Storms, right? That's exactly what I was thinking, I guess. Yeah, yes, our small friend merit here, you have the right person. Is a not from here. You know, I am coming to see that. Of if you want to can stop introducing. 

You as that that's completely up to you? No, it's fine by me. I am the writer of the ones. Oh, anyway, well for those of you who might not be aware, Syndrome is the Lord of storms. One of the titans that many years here But if I've got this and the dragon, For the Titans had grown higher of the invaders. 

Us in the fighting. Well. 

Us. She specifically points at Helios belt or cadimallic and her son, she does not point at merit and We? Us five being natives of. We were considered outsideers long ago. And the Titans were weary of our presence After all. They were paying, and And they wanted to microsoft, well, the five deities didn't. 

Well, when they came to be fair, they weren't originally here. When they arrived, they took people on people like us. More. And wanted to safeguard us against the rapidly. And with the egg of the dragon words, The forces of the deities, fought the forces of the heights, Which is passed down to history, as Most of us here are However, for our To becomes. 

The war was long out. And was terrible. Destruction was meant In order to try and save God, what will the life still remain? He just came up with an idea. A pack. We all know acts are very important. You do not. Make it. And regards to the deities and titans, they are not capable. 

Of breaking your back. So I packed this truck. And hope. Of he switches lasting for the past 500 years. Power. It seems that we are running out of time. This board is one example. Of. Syndrome in forcing his With. Against. Best, as I can tell, both from trying to ask around the locate. 

And from what the Lord was told me this floor was originally just an ordinary board. The power that had yields now can only come from something far greater. And I don't mean this as an insult, and then any of us take So it is very difficult. And is most likely being powered by outfairy angry deity. 

So, I think it's quite big that's man. It's good to know what we're up against. So, If you're interested. You have only called because the Oracle sees greatness in each of Some of you. I don't quite know why, and I hope that you don't take that personally because I'm having I was, are you sure it's me like, I'm never even hunted like anything I just What about I I hit drones and say the roots. 

I understand and your talent from music class is quite well known throughout materials specifically, but a lot of other places of value, My will admit I have not the slightest idea. But she's foresaw that you were a part of this and that is why you received the letter from Delivered by its true. 

So I can't. That's it. A question. You have every right? I suppose to go back home. Should you wish to But I have no idea what that'll do. I don't think is she define the word of the orcos? Seems like a very stupid thing. Well, she's never been wrong. 

For the record, the Oracle is a very important individual. She was gifted with foresight remission and unlike a lot of practitioners that attended to Design the future. As I hope. So as You've seen people attempt to Little bit. I yeah, you could say that she Has never been wrong of fiction. 

So she is forcing that for one reason or another, the six of you are important to trying to safeguard Thailia from its imminent destruction, I have no idea why And I certainly hope that she's right because, you know, And again, I don't But any safeguard is better than However, Between you and me. 

I think a little Testing. Is. So the more is a problem, This kid. And this is, While I talk with her. And Apple. Test. When the cheese is confident, we will build one that I am a little lesser but that's why I'm not the article. 

Both slaying this beast is what we need to do. It will be done. Thank you. Is there a specific part of the hard lands where the beast has been seen? 

I believe the answer to that is here and then we just double check. Oh good. 

Everything. Concur. The one I've been told there are a number of hunters here. Who have recently been tracking it and know that it is Northwood from our current position? Probably not that far. But I would inquire with them at the mall. Understood. 

All right. Where am I? We find them and then Just right out of here. He literally points over to the inkkeep who is still talking with 200, okay? And as you look, you actually do, see that one of them has like What looks to be a pretty recent like just gash all the way up is on one is, right? 

So we should be fine, right? Because if we are foreseen to do something helpful, That we must succeed. Is there a way It'd be a good adventure. Sure. Keep that. And she hands you a skill. Oh boy, you read it. You really quickly and it's literally title. That the tragedy. 

The beginning and it talks about a great hero. Long ago. We did many wondrous deeds and ended in a terrible way Hmm. What's the name of the person who's there? There will be another 

Got Steve. The name of this individual. 

It won't creative. You advertisements, go away. Blowing the immersion. Sorry, very fine. I do. Peter. Entity of To feel the tragedy of things. My favorites, fetuses. 

And she oh you want this back? Well yes, it's one of my compositions. Oh, you simply written. If I do to say so myself, of course. Oh. I love a good simile. Excellent imagery. Not to talk my own horn, but I am a focus on. Now, these are that I do. 

Remember I was talking about this. But, And a wild couple of days, I was starting to wonder if I hadn't quite made an impression upon you first. But that's all right. A lot transplant. Very Okay, you are in and out of school for Well. One of seven. 

Should we talk to these hunters? See, I don't think it's 

I'm down for the adventure. So, The quick meal and a quick drink, but don't put onto. We can go and then a quick killing of a boar. All that will hopefully be quick. Have you seen much of battle marrying? I've seen it is not always Swift. I've seen many things. 

Involved. I don't know too much about that bad that don't know how to say that one about that but oh I know. Is it just we can we can take care of a boy. Although I feel like we, I feel like I always boss over this. Are you like a robot or something? 

What's going on here? And you have like a little liz? Appreci. It's a her, I've never seen. About orders. I've made my whole life in the wonderful city of Looking at all four. Next. Yes, as opposed introductions are in order. We all know we briefly know each other and you know all of us. 

But for our new friend and a bit. And I've lost it the way I wanted to phrase that and before the recent acquaintances, I'm Helios of this story is the city Helios of a story as I'm sure you can tell I fight with spear and shield. Well, Matt I am cutting engine as, you know. 

Through of the academy at bridros. I don't really find. I'd play music. Oh, how do you do? I could go, I could always go for some music. My name is Merrick. And I am a wizard. Oh yes. You watch. She's literally writing things down like on an open scroll as she's listening. 

Any sketch of married building. Little fingers. Vote. My name is Ira. I don't really a hail from a small village outside of my throats. Keep on mysterious. Just, I am outdoor from me choice as well. So I was sent here by my patron and patiently The luck and meet you all. 

Where? Where Metro's? It just what? If we we're really through. But we'll get the we can do that. On the way to meet the board for fight the board of board. It's near each other. Yeah. But the person 

That. Yes, yeah. It is killing people. Right time is obvious essence. Say so. Not to rush. This is your story, but But maybe. Well then there's nothing to do but get on with it I'm pulling up my wand and make it sparkle more. It's like Telling me better barred. 

No, that's your voice again. No, that's So, it wasn't it, but No, I don't know is exact location. I know that he is alive. And I know that he is. All right. Safe. 

Search for taking care of beasts. 

You may not work. They won't be long before they seem again. 

So speed why allowing to go over the hunters? Yeah. So Helios and Balthau are you make your way over to the hunters and the injector? She turns us both of you walk over. And if you go, ah, couple of newcomers to my humble tattoo, what can I do for the two of you? 

We've stick information. Then we have heard about a board ravaging dollar plan seven north appear immediately. Posted glass down. I see. You both have heard of this. And we have well, What exactly are you looking at, for? If I'm Well, we seek to put an end to it location first. 

The interesting. To be fair and just to get this on the table, You wouldn't be the first group that had been looking for it. So we've been known, we understand. Have certainly hope that you do After all and peace, take those steps. My name is. Atomic. 

I have been in the heartlands for a long time. 100 bike, profession myself before I eventually retire. I've seen a many good hunter taking down by the Then he go out and he don't return. But if you are truly as confident as Well, if you perfectly honest, as you present yourself, Had similar to yourself. 

Then I will not stand it away. She's after fingers and both the hunters. Stand pop sailing to give her deadlines. She turns to them and says so. Why Why don't you explain what happened to your last scout? Yes. Not four days ago. The hunting party that I was a part of Captured, our query ahead of schedule. 

And so, we wanted to inspect and make sure That these bore. Follows a pattern that we have been seeing for the past couple of Weeks. It seems to do a very similar pattern where it will. Go out hunting. Which is unusual for a boy of any kind. And that is with always return. 

To a cave, a natural rock formation to be north of town and it always seems to go back there. For what purpose and reason I really can't say. Afterwards, you get to a number of days. We figured that the one of us had enough men power to take this thing. 

So we played we waited for night before. To wait for the peace to go into some to take it by surprise. Well. And he shows you his arm and it is like it looks like an unbelievable like line from wrist like all the way down to shoulder of just like this long gash and he goes I was still lucky one. 

The rest were concerned. I can tell you that this thing is, Powerful. The, our arrows seem to Not even pierce its skin. It's time seems to be so much thicker than the borers should be. But, At the very least, I can't tell you. It does follow this pattern. Almost tooty they're almost seems to be no divergence from outside of eat, traveling, father and father, In Gutans. 

Once it's started at the edge and then proceeds inward, each time getting a little farther in but it will always go back to the same path. So, We can take you there. And guarantee it will be there at some point. Usually at night, it is almost never there during the day. 

Don't know what else you'll be able to find farmers are too afraid to even speak of it. With Reese. We believe God, we do not have a lot of truth. Any, you see him kind of start to get a little apprehensive about what he's about to say. And then I tell a stamp back steps forward. 

Your farmers are there? They're afraid that by speaking of this creature and of that. Terrible. For it person. That will single math for fun. You will not find any answers outside of the people. The Bill Powercast that there is no one else will improve give a but be reasonable with that. 

They are simple followers and this kind of thing is very threatening for those that is When you know how to kill them, of course, but we have our poor indo location. Here. Java. And Tennis will accompany you and lead you to the location. And should they be able to? 

They will attempt to aid in whatever way they have. Mm. Impossible, I would ask. 210. That is the goal. Yes. Foolish said they may be, they are like myself. 

We do not wish to fight it again. And pleased to hear. Think of it as a worried. Thank you for the information. I understand this, My pleasure and I'll put this out there if you do manage to kill this thing, Exam. I know it seems like the poultry the reward, but at the moment, it is the best. 

Thank you, man. Well, that was happening. Merrick, Ira, Kadeem, and Kelly. Anything you want to do well, Helios and Bellefontaine were talking. This bomb made him, right? Mr. Bard. Do you think you could have any songs for us? What are we going to battle? Oh, it doesn't absolutely anything about boards. 

Perhaps. Sure. I think I can work something out. That would be most, excellent. Are you a fan of music? I guess you could say that. Yeah. Is there to know what else? Yes. Well you think there's 20 different types of music? Of course, I like many of the types but there's something I don't like. 

We are one of the same that I think most people show that we experience. Very good then. I will be sure to play something that has all I do, but I will do it as long as it comes from the art. Or else this music. Using priests, but the local chords and stuff, change the heart and finals, an instrument on your Indeed. 

Anything can be an instrument, but What is that one? I've never seen anything like it. Which one do your instrument? And we hope drums and subjects the loop. Bring. Fascinating life. I have not. Maybe if you are nothing like that before, it's that one seems to be be a bit more. 

Yeah, different shape than I'm used to. Where you from? What? Well care is doing the same thing. She's a look like what's a loot? I don't know. And she's just like, are you? Well, you've you see I travel all over the place. I don't exactly I gathered that. I'm somewhere in Valley but I don't know where that is. 

Where were you originally from? Well did you see? I've been to many places. I've been to Walter deep. I've, I've even spent a short time in Borovia. So we had called earlier, so don't know. As a terrible place. We aren't from. Originally. 

Okay. It's at this point that helios, and Golf or come back and Cara goes. Well. I need to have a quick conversation with. I'll sorry. To watch who she walks over. Well, it seems we have a location for our quarry. The hunters. We were introduced to can take us to the Beast's layer where it apparently always resides or returns to it night. 

Have you ever hunted for? I've killed quite a few of them. The hunt, not so much, but till plenty of animals, just one would expect Getting tips. Think the stick. Here's a tip and that's it. Yes, don't die. Actually, to help keep that one. I haven't done that yet. 

Well. This mayor this fire has and I guess or he doesn't know that he's just like every adventure marriage thought? He's just come back in a different place. I just redeemed, but in all seriousness. I mean, I can give some pointers but To learn how to truly fight is one that takes a lifetime of dedication. 

You. All right, thanks. So be wasted about Though, I wouldn't say that everyone's got their ways of fighting. True. I'm sure the good bard has plenty that he can do. He may surprise even himself. I can do some magic with music of. But nothing so much number five, anything For. 

Well in that case let those of us who were more familiar, get up close in person. I would recommend keeping your distance, I'm like a newborn child in this field of However, Well, there's always plenty to fight. As long as you're, you're fighting the right things. Well, she also said that this was a test, So it will be more. 

What do you think? Do you think it's a test to make sure it's actually evil before we kill it? No. Well, I think certain that this beast needs to be put down. It's a testimonial at this moment. I What? This one I suppose is a any other talk. We have we can do on the Wednesday. 

I mean, let's let's get going then. Do you want for the first? Should we do it to go food order? Maybe I like before, maybe I'm that camera and the two hunters come up and she goes. So I just just talking with these individuals and it looks like they want to Pick up a few supplies before they need you, on the way towards this cave in the book, They would request that you will be ready to leave and be out front in and out. 

Easily done. Let's do. Okay. She says could the two hunters and the three of them actually walk out of the town. Absolutely. Order food or something, right? Some food would be a wise idea, don't gorge yourself, the stomach can. Calls nerves on the first fight, and it's good to know. 

I was, but it's not wise that you don't an empty stomach either. The energy right now. Okay, I'll go with the horse and food. All right, maybe there's a roller company, impressive selection. She has things that range from things that need to be eaten here. Two things that can be very easily stored and then not needing to be. 

Reheated can be eaten later. She provides a number of each type. To each of you, something to be eaten here and then something that can be eaten at a later point in time. Either during the day or perhaps if leaving the perhaps, the next day as it's been salted and prepared in a way that will keep for a while. 

Basically on the go rations but we're not just rations. It's actually better. Yeah. How much will this be back? We'll say that this is the love. If you make it back, I thought you clicked that song. Of course. Thank you all to Before we could save it, you know, I like it. 

And put it this way, pay for your team with especially designs. When an epic. Celebration pronouncing the victim. Of the heroes. Over the dreaded beasts of, Sounds, fantastic and we'll get to work. That I will take us the pain. It will be great. Have high aspect of Excellent. Right? 

Anything? Anybody would like to do, or we will fast forward an app. Nope, I'm good. I'm doing fast, forwarding. All right, we fast forward an hour. You all pack up from sitting around and interacting the monster selves you walk outside and you see the two hunters javelin and tenious packed and ready. 

They had their longbows on their back. They have a number of packs and what seems to be just materials on them. And you also see Cara who seems to be packed and ready, scrolls and parchment. And Inking, quill and all Hmm. And, Shall we get guys? Absolutely. I'll write you two. 

Yes, show us the way you do. The two hunters, not they start off, northward out of town. Above. It's not first, don't you think? You know what they got. So how do I say, how do you want to do that? He can do it or I can, it have a lot. 

Do you have chrome? I don't have chrome but doesn't have to be chrome. Yes, it does have to be for Chrome unfortunately, that I transferred this you doesn't have to be transferred. Well, I haven't brought up in at. Yeah, that's fine. Because Chrome can cast your entire yes. So I have to open it in front. 

Well you can well I like I said it depends on how you want to do. It just chromemail can either do the tab or your entire screen. Okay. It's I know it's super fucking stupid and weird but It's what we're dealing with, okay? Yeah. 

So, we can say calling because that's where I'm at. Who should all right? Yeah, this is. Oh, that's all right. Yeah. Okay, so they hosting anyone? Okay, this is an yes Is the same one there. What is it? Yes, container the bedroom. Yeah, just Team is not been on a boat. 

We'll go into kill a boy About. It's not gonna be a boy, Any more you should be more. And bored. Oh, This heard you again, and I thought you said, I thought you said, we're going to kill a boy. What? Oh, going to kill him. But it's actually Feeling so cool. 

Steve had the biggest glasses. Like Dominic I don't work. It's enough. It's very fuzzy. She's going to be fuzzy. Wow that's fine. I can't get close to it. Okay. Well this is just supposed to be kind of the general. It's a world vacation that doesn't pulls out a very Not highly detailed map. 

This is the players guide, too. It is just yeah, I'm just trying to use it just for the man, I don't know. I was just saying just in case we want to stop. It's fine. Okay, anyways as you get on the way, No. Nope no that's just projecting like LEDs. 

Well anyway, Giovanni pulls out a, it works for the purpose. Yeah. And at this point, it's a hastily drawn mouth. Yeah, of the general area and he points out the path that you will be taking kind of into the Out of the sour vintage and the nearby town kind of into the rocky terrain kind of pointing out the general path that you're going to be taking to get to this Boars cave. 

I would say somebody. Make a survival check. To aid the two hunters, the hunters are helding it, but you're giving me. So somebody role with what I'm good at that. I have not particularly well you're probably the best that if you have efficiency I don't know if I can roll but You said that advantage? 

Yeah. Okay, yeah, 23 23 even though the map is pretty rough. Just skank you're very You have a lot of experience with Maneuvering around different times and very strange kinds of children. So you take the map and you look at it and you expect to have that they're proposing and you take a look at the kind of the rock and the terrain and you look at the path that they were mapping out and you go. 

Okay that can work but this way it's been And you kind of go back and forth with the hunters because they're going back the way they came. Yeah the I know this works. Yeah. It might not be the most efficient and between discussing it you eventually do convince them and they that they start following you more than your following them. 

It's kind of like your leading the path and they're pointing out like, okay, they're gonna go like slightly more that way a little bit more to the west. So a little bit more north and Doing this. I want to actually manage to cut off a number of hours to get back and while they were expecting and kind of telling you that this was going to be more or less than all day, kind of journey you get that about half the time they expected to drop you relatively at about eight o'clock or later you're arriving. 

There about four o'clock. You made very good time because of that, and that was a high 23. So, yeah. Sorry. So you eventually Come. To it kind of like an overcrop like wrong. Looking down from this height, you see miles of mountainous hills to the west. I thick blackhead of fog, hangs over the lower land and you can hear the gentle chorus of birds greeting. 

The more greeting the day. Yeah. Oh, What, as you pass you do, notice. Off to the sides Things that you're seeing. But avoiding because it's not directly to the cave. You do see the trail at this bore has caused my You see down trees, smash rocks. Rocks that once stood large in size, absolutely reduced the pebbles and you see trails, Blood. 

I'm gonna kill this bowler. 3D it is unnerving. I was like, oh I'm intentionally not looking at any of the blood and just being like staying far away. 

Just, Eventually. However, From your overcrop and not overcrowd. From your elevated position, you can look down and you see almost kind of like a bullshape valley and a very noticeable opening in the rock. And, Slightly surprised the two hunters. You do hear a series of ear, spilling grumps and squeals. 

Coming from 

Other ones more or like human. Makes perception check. Definitely more nature and not only are they definitely more or pig like in nature. You can tell. Because she was lived in the city. Most of your life. You didn't really work with animals but you had a lot of neighbors, a lot of friends that did. 

It's not exactly the same but it's similar enough to some of the sounds that a friend's farm animals, specifically their pigs would make when they were sleeps waiting specifically. Well, now you can't like the pigs like in dreams. I will really definitely say. The noises, the squisher makes sounds as though, like basically Lot of better time than now to kill it. 

Okay hunters go well yes Javon and Tanias are still with you. They're both kind of looking a little Not startled. Well, actually no start all these probably the closest they're both kind of doing this and like fucking quietly because This is not normally where the board is at this time, right? 

Especially not sleeping and especially not sleeping. It's earlier. So this is different than what they were expecting and you can tell by the looks on their faces that they're like, I don't know what's different. You try to attack it balls and sleep, right? Yes, it Unfortunately, I think we made the biggest mist. 

Bro. 

Service to drive. And drawing it out. So what you're saying is to try to trick you, By pretending to sleep. Okay, or you're saying that. By being in its layer. So to speak it has a, it has the upper hand I'm going to be taking almost I I shuttered to think, if the creature is intelligence enough to 

Certainly don't want. Evacuated. Now, it was just a beast that had an advantage. Then still the same reason, not. In. Gradually said the tripod. We did have a thought about that and the both of them pull off the packs and start unpacking them and you can see That they have about 50 foot of rope. 

They have what appears to be like, some relatively small. But sturdy looking shovels and also some, very specifically widowed not super big, but like maybe like half an arms length, wouldn't stay like a number of them, not a huge amount but a reasonable one. They also have. 

Actually. Yeah, those are the the three main things that they have. That these are some of the items we were able to collect. They could be used for some kind of thought. Trap or snail depending on how you wish to use. 

I have both. We should. Think probably enough. Really are they big enough for like a big bore? From what we've seen based on the, I do apologize. Maker supplies. We were in provide We have three likely options of, we could attempt to set up a ropes manner. The rope we had would be enough to set up a like a trip line to try and entice the beast out to trip it. 

The shuttles would be in a tenant to try and create a A hastily dog pitfall. And that's where some of these spikes could come into play or setting up the spikes in a kind of barred barb debt. To try and trick the beast into running. No those are things that we as hunters have used before for you know, creature similar to this liability, that I will not know how effective it would be against. 

As far as weird concern. And the advantages. Maybe. 

Don't really, I can't believe it. What? That would have got unplugged. Yeah. Well the wall refuses. That is Jovan is about to say something else. You do see that ghost covering kind of reaches out. That. Make sure to hit us. For and she's just looking at. And, Me three words to combat to be a type of thing. 

I don't think of digging a whole movie. I say you strike while the iris is hot. Yeah. We could just go in there and get it. We should have a witness, that's what they just did. We should, at least we're a little bit but But I like being here, which requ. 

Requires. It's always more doable and fast fast. Snare roll setting up a barricades and spikes removed quick, right? 

If anybody knows how to do that kind of thing. Otherwise, I'll just be ready with my magic. Me I can help set the snares right since my would I know how to do snares and stuff. Since at this point that Giovanni wants to get pipes up. If you choose to go with one of those traps, we could set them up. 

We know how to set them and prepare them to be most effective. For trapping animals, that would allow the rest of you to be to prepare to seize upon whatever advantage, the trap would set. So I think that perhaps myself in tennis should Laid the traps as best we can, and then Find immoral advantage spot for us to try and cover you without us. 

Degree just four is as fast as I'm thinking it might be a disagree but that Might be more dangerous trying it out over. Our thought would be to try and do it inspiredly, possible, not browse it, or give it caused and noticing thing and then allow The six of youth turned, how to lower it down. 

Okay, I think we should just do one. You take the smell of blood aboard about I think that. Possibility. What do how much? The PC used to be coated in it. And put it in others blood. I don't know if that would regular but perhaps it is fresh that month has Can't say. 

We're not my large metal campaign and I have an idea on how to draw it out. Lot of noise. Right, I'm good. As am I? Okay. So what do we want to try to set a trap quietly? I say we do that but anyone who doesn't want to be up close and personal may want to wait back. 

I shall be in the back. Wait waiting to set off my magic. Maybe we should put the trap if we wanted to engage the trap instead of having to be there. That was yeah, to keep our homes away, right? I was referred to your wisdom. 

I mean he wants to set the trap. But I'm in nothing. It is a gonna set and this when I do it it's like difficult. Yeah, I forget what yours does, I will call my conductor stick another at the top the time and I will ding one of the Times and like is like a verberating aware and when you in case of milk I'm not stopping you but you do that.
