Bringing tide to their victory over. Corrupt or that had been slain townspace farmers hunters alike. Causing me rampant destruction in chaos in the islands. You would turn. Being victorious. A large celebration was bad in your arm as many of the town came out to celebrate in the shower vintage with the new forthcoming heroes. 

Conversations were had a brief conversation with had between IRA and hero as Dallas had started to correct brief in. To Iris mind as to if this was the right. If this was the right time, Spirits reinvigorate. He joined the rest of you, We inside to celebrate drinks. Were had food was had stories, were told songs were song. 

Dance was had It was quite a festive evening, But waking up the next day you prepared for your journey to the temple of the orchid, who Kira had said now that you have surpassed the supposed test, that the Oracle sent up, that it is time to meet her and converse with her. 

Rousinger, rather. Inebriated. Hungover Kira, you set up on your drink making quick and relatively easy travel to the temple of New York. Finding the entrance, being a dissent into a chasm. Where individuals had to be decline or in certain cases floats or walk. You descended down into the chasm leading towards the area of Along the way you were set upon by a number of whisk like spirits, who attempted to weigh lay you, as you descended down, however, they were a little impact. 

Dear person. Making it down to the bottom of the pan. You saw before you be outside of the temple, large stone pillars and what appeared to be a statue of apparently sit bomb hero mentioned it was However you also saw Four individuals. Clarendon Road. Did the keen site of Iraq? 

Membership. Carrying his symbol. 

Depending to make it to the other side of the small river that float in front of the temple, you were less than successful at being particularly stealthy. Drawing the attention of these four apparently garments. Notice you, and Demanding to know what business you are. Merrick introduced himself as his is his desire set. 

Actually, raising me. It was immediately. Eldridge blast through this individual killing the other three however, did manage to stay in the attempts. You pursue and coming into the temple proper, or at least the entranceway of the temple. So you saw a number of things, you saw the three would be lookouts, right? 

You saw a number of others, one particularly adorned with final one who seemed to have taken who had taken a number of A hostage, The eldest of the acolytes humbly, assault me above status, then the normal individuals, who work at this time, seem to be a desperately thinning with this headquarters saying that begging him to stop the witch from doing any more terrible things to the article to which the lead cultist did not reply favorable. 

Seeing you all in this key initiative initiated a confrontation. You've been one of the items that you've been giving by the members of the calling initiating, however, even though the surprise went above attack was his, the ultimate victory was yours. As you methodically flew, all of the culprits. Mom. 

During the confrontation hearing about, The Witch and something potentially happening to the Oracle decided to attempt to find. Where's this might be happening Blowing through one of the doors leading further back into the castle. And that is where we return, The cultists have been slain and the older gentleman who was at one point in time. 

Arguing with the cult leader cultist. Leader was desperately pleading with you to follow him to where Dispute might. So, are we still standing there? Is he already started leaving the way. What does obvious grab? Hold of Merrick? And it started to walk towards that door. I'm going to walk over that way, but on the way over, I'm going to do two things. 

I'm going to second wind and then use my healing hands on myself. Especially. But since we're at, you know, out of combat. You acting him. No, it's just, you can't. I can't just really not that bad of a punishment for being able to take two acts that you have basically obliterated and kill yourself. 

Right? You watch as Balthazar walks through the hole that he just created in that door. Left this old. Yeah, I'll kind of wait for it. It's as I see him, I'll wait to see which door he leads him. Is everybody else coming from a phone? 

So you all notice that fewer actually seems to be like slightly doubled over like sweating profusely with a grimace of painos and Kadeem. You both notice that there seems to. It's almost like like, as you walk pot it's almost like seeing something very briefly but it's almost as though like symbols or starting to appear on like the side of her of her face where there were previously, not At what time is? 

It was way too fast. Like this walking by, she just kind of gone. Ready. Sorry You all recon. Well, the rest of you catch up to Merrick and the older gentleman who is going, please follow me this way, We have to go fartherine towards the cabinet section of these and he would lead you. 

No, not that way. The towards the other door. And I appears on the door. And it immediately. Disintegrate, Goodbye everybody. It was nice snowing but I know who these effects usually targets, right? It's me. Is mad a problem? A cloth strike that would have guaranteed hit the man, the man takes a step back. 

Stepping on his rope slightly as he slips like lashes out above his head as he managed to catch himself. So he doesn't fall from but he did slightly move out of the way it is going to do. Its bite attack against you. 

I like this mirror. Yeah, that's what. This was actually a call. That's not a current address. All right. So I guess we will do initiative. Okay. 

Please give me thank you. Well, 19 for it. Six. It's about nine. I guess total. Wow, I'm going to say because it's not take long for you to kill. I want those of you that are a bit more experience, Balfour, Ira and Merrick I'd say you all kind of get the gist that as you're more experienced. 

Travelers you having not really traveled as much but it fought a large. Number of things You get the sense. This is less of a creature. This is more of a trip. The old man gets kind of fully rights himself passes. Please follow me and he rushes downstairs. All right, I'm going to zoom in. 

Oh my God. 

I think right there, you come out at 6:00. And yeah, we're somewhere in there at 6:00. Of steaming hot. You can hear water cascading into the underground river at the river king. 

Do I see the Oracle Make a percentage? Come on, You do not currently see the Oracle. However, it could be. You do here. From where your position. You do hear coming, basically in front of you, so do East of where you're currently standing, You do hear a low. 

I'm just follow. And that's what you get. I will relay that room, my fellows. Where did you hear that from? Is the old man still next to us? Not a bad idea. Except I would also like to look and see if there any more traps later along the way. 

What is that modified? Nothing. So that's our 15. Along the way. I'm assuming you all start making your way out this way. Nothing catches your eye Helios. The only thing that you do notice is that across the way in? Kind of the small little like Iowa. There are a number of what looks to be. 

Relatively old, but comfortable looking rocks. Just laid on top kind of in a almost like a sitting pattern where people would probably sit. That's really all that you see. I'm just going to keep going. 

Do those people back a little bit Reese. Thank you. You see that there is an at this point from this angle. Now you can clearly see that there is a bend around here. Yeah. Stay back. Yeah, it might be a little dangerous for you. I understand that but it is my duty to ensure the safety will be of the old. 

I will do whatever I can but it's the first though. So, And he does your reposition and he does say that he would assume at this point that they are back in the Oracle's team. How how is your pants Are you going quickly? Are you going quickly Definitely quickly? 

It's like, it's like a good job for me. I'm pretty slow. I'm talking to someone. Yeah, yeah. We'll go at the same time Which would be my maximum of 20. Okay. So the second question is, are you going quiet or how quietly are you going? I I am not quiet because I'm like, effectively going my max speed. 

I mean that this is I guess a question of if we want to be stealthy, we will have to move slower. Yeah, I'm not planning on it. Yeah, we should probably just move quickly. Quickly and hope that is she doesn't fireball the second we round the bed. Hopefully, we're not diving yet. 

We're going deeper. 

Okay, since none of you are going particularly quietly, one person as the group roll spell, check with this event because you're not trying to be. So I just want to see how perceptive this into, I got it. Yep, first one was 18. 13. What if you all like a three and you had all your portables? 

That was a one, Could you change your rule to one? You have to be rolling because you're halfway? Yes, it does work interesting. Well, this is disorienting I'm trying to put it at like beer, Hold on. But I didn't do it. Is that the right orientation? No. I thought it would I thought it would go one of those directions so it would be easier and you can see that. 

From this angle, you can't see a lot because well it's not a shear wall. It's like slightly collapse here so you can see some of it but not everything. What you do see me? You do see basically seemingly suspended up in the air. A beautiful woman in Golden Retinant stretched above. 

The like the ground kind of like Barnes house. You see? Very cutting it. It's more like seeing a distortion because you don't see the full effect yet, but it seems, as though there are tendrils of some kind of substance that seem to be wrapped around this woman holding her a lot. 

You do hear a once again, you do hear a If you just, I swear to have happened. And you see the woman suspended is like there is cloth like covering her mouth and like eyes boring down at someone probably the person talking. Just it's like a yes you can't see all of it though. 

From your current just this woman. How a lot just screaming into the cat. Now, you do hear the old older tell me. I'm going to, I'm going to run up and I'm going to I'm going to start attacking the witch with You don't see her. We have to move up and around. 

First, I'm going to do it. We should definitely stagger thoughts. Will you break my? I'll bring it back soon. Lol. 7:15, 18 or 10:13? Get a better. Look at this person. That is suspended. You immediately recognize her. So do you okay. The both of you don't get quite as good of a luck due to her attempted struggling and the orientation that you have arranged yourself but Helios, you and Khalid both recognize the woman suspended, apparently shouting and rage is the deal. 

Okay, I see some of you. Yes. I mean I probably be ahead with you videos. I'll be I'll be in the rear with the gear cuz I'm slow. The old man. Not you He's pretty old like 40. So like 35 40. I'm running. I mean, like I said, just stagger them out because I'm not trying to get blown up. 

I think we would be together. Well, we already kind of separated out so yeah, forward Abominable being the fact that this cave is relatively echoey and who are pretty close you Helios do here as you start like making the final push towards this. Yeah, it's not going to be open anymore. 

As you start making your final push up towards the, the chamber of the oracle, you do hear a raspy voice and you watch as Two more cultists. I'm around to the entrance, right, as well. So I assume we haven't been quite rounded the corner yet. 

Yes. Put them there, Helios and Ira like they come, literally, come around the corner swords drawn as you to Rushville. Stop. Then other people coming. But this, yes, so everybody wrote 

The black guy still lol. Minecraft. Paradise. 

Okay, great. This is Merrick Alarastype You were with him when he you brought him up from the brink of death, Stop doing this. Well, that means it can only come through in time is great need. I don't think I appreciate that. I don't know, maybe it's into that. I mean, 

Terrible. What's the luckily? All your stress is America? I'm going to try to hit them. Hopefully, I can. I'm going to poke things with my pointy stick. If these two next, And there should over there. This one like on the red thing. That's the thing that's holding the one Holding up. 

We have art. You you run up just in the entrance as the two soldiers step in front of the doorway, raising their swords, You're out for your stage. Okay, Well, I guess the blue one. When irony? For my perspective, I literally can't see them because of papers in the one. 

Okie dokie. 

That does not happen. 

13, does not. 

Crazy. I do a, what I'm strike through butter section. Well, does not run in throwing your fish out, but this soldier called it seems to be prepared. And he puts his shield up in front of each of your fists already. He is going to rebut. You going to make is two attacks on you. 

That's a 18. That's a nine slashing from the first attack. Destroy is a natural 20. All right, that's an additional eight points. That was his time. 

I suppose. Well, I didn't was available 10 ft. If the room like over here, I know it looks like 1510. Well, it depends on where you're jumping from From where you're currently standing. It's a man that's hard to see the lines. Yeah, it's about like 7:00 maybe 10:00 From where you're currently standing. 

It might be thinner if you move forward. You're not yet. Why don't you expect it inspected the water. Okay. And since this would be an investigation that'll be an accident. If you want to try to jump, you're going to want to do a running long jump so you would need to move 10 ft before you jump. 

Oh okay, I want that cuz a standing so of running long jump, you can long. Jump a distance equal to your strength score, but if you standing long jump, I'm pretty sure it's half that. So you probably couldn't just standing longer. 

Yeah, I I'd say if you move to like where the old man is or about where Belfar is, you could see both of them. Wisdom, that is a 60. The bonus action, expired Elio's. I'll slap my chimes. Okay, that'll do it for me. You don't have another fucking action surge. 

Are you a fighter? 

Aspect of living in flight. I like dragon, mommy better. I just we're back to talking about why we are playing dungeons and dragons that you know of yet. Or dummy mommy. For sure. ? If I'd like to use, if I, if I use the one with and move, one of them with that book opportunity on me for you being moved against their will. 

I'll just 

That's not what you got. 20 something hits. 

7 piercing. Yeah. Okay. Anything else? 

They're effectively blocking the insurance, right? Like so even if I still defend over to be able to get past them, You're still defender would have to make an acrobatics or an athletics to try and like squeeze past them. It couldn't just move there. I can't climb. No, I didn't remember if it's good or not. 

I have something in my back pocket but I don't know what it is. Just sound. 

Stock. 

What? I thought it might be yours for some reason, You're married. If it fits your finger, I'm going to lose my shit. I mean, it very clearly doesn't like Like it doesn't fit like it's short. It's pretty close. I'm calling. Matt got married without us knowing I don't know. 

Wow. Sense like September, I'll go ahead and start off attacking and go one that has been damaged. The lowest one is a 19. I guess all damage. Okay? And then they said, you could use that first one What appears to be a weird like creature made of water holding the oracle ball. 

You see a two? What? Almost looked like minor cultists there. They're not wearing armor not nearly as much as the other ones that you've been facing. They each have a dagger in front of them and they're standing in front of a Blue skin, like almost looking like they have like scales, massive like greenish tangled messed hair, almost like fish like features. 

In her face, long pointed teeth a dagger in one hand and you see another acolyte dental Throat has been slapped already. Anything else that I think will be if for nowhere? Is pallet and Ira on the same square. I was like halfway in. Yep. Yep. So Yeah, so Caleb's on the line, I was fully yet, so however you want to play that. 

No. I mean we shouldn't be on the lines. Button. Yeah, I will say go ahead and give me. 

It might take a little bit more movement as you try and like finagle through. As this is not a lot of space 13 deck, You're fine. You manage to get in position without losing any additional And then I'd like to be able to look in. I'm going to say, yes, the, the paint the paper makes it a little hard, but it looks like you should be able to see him, right? 

Okay. Yeah, early. If that's what I was in thinking. So Do I see the witch? You see a blue skin creature? Like I described to Helios and you see the two less trained looking cultists and I would see and you would get Down Underground. I didn't see that. Was I forgot? 

I would like to go ahead and move my ex to And, and I'm going to pick strength, like check. In case somebody cries the like mail layers or crap or something, so doesn't really matter a whole lot now. But I'm going to move my hacks and then I'll just watch. 

Okay, I need to make Where the Bellflower? I need you to make a contested charisma, check to make sure that your ex can affix to this creature. I guarantee you succeed I rolled like really shitty, I mean, the plus five minimum The shadowy form of your hats starts to engulf this creature and there seems to almost be like a rain of electricity that seems to match the position of the hex that seems to almost try and get in the way, but the shadows of a hex override it and latch on. 

Okay? All right, I'm going to do my laundry supply. Yeah, that's my main lady. Yes, doubled as well. And then, depending on the wrong time, 

Okay, different than normal. 22, 22 damage. Your elders flash shoots into this creature and you take a sizable chunk of ink her shoulder. 

Okay, just using it. 14 14 and 14, just hits. 

11 11, 11 more damage as your second. One strikes, home already. This creature is looking pretty wrapped up. See, I've done there. I will say even it wasn't going before any more forward, that entrance is kind of clogged up with people. You're going to have to do a text check like that, right. 

Can I just hit the other guy that's still there? Yes, you can hit. You can see the other guy. All right, I'm going to go ahead and try to hit him with Firebolt. 

You part of your fireball and he deflects it with issue. That's it. I actually, since this is important, could I use a lucky on that? I don't know. I have to do it before, but I will prepare. I will prepare it just in case you get ready to attack me. 

I can impose disadvantage. Well yeah I'm pretty sure they're just part of the lucky features if something gets tagged so you can use your reaction to it. Steven Allen. I've been messing up too. We need to retroactively I can't do that in the past. Excuse me. I moved with 10. 

15\. 2825. Kind of 30. I mean, it's hard. Yeah, you all need to make wisdom Because you have seen me this creature. Question. Yes. Is it a child effect? 

It is not a dog, Okay. Actually, no, I'm not. You cute. Yes, no, no. Speaking 14, okay? 1418, you are fine, 14, you are fine, you are a flight. You are playing of this creature. 

Is there is there? Like she likes shooting something out. When it happens when they recycle active. She is now going to use her death glare on it. I need you to make a another wisdom saving through Seven. Okay. You dropped a zero headphones? Against this. I guess I I assume the effect doesn't say that they dropped it here. 

Zero hit points about our stable. 

But you're not automatically unless the effects says like, they drop the zero hit points. Butter stable. I don't know if there's any effects of do that actually. I feel like there's somewhere else. I wouldn't felt that I asked about that. That is the Seahawks turn. It is now the soldier that was right there the soldier. 

Does not like the fact that helios got the stop behind him. He is going to race. Can you move the soldier around, not leaving, melee range of theaters, like outside And now he's going to take his attacks on you. 

200\. You get. 

I was his turn. And now, let me just verify something real quick. You watch as the the weird kind of water creature seems to shift ever so slightly. But then we like, go back to its original position. As when it started to shift, you watch the Oracle seem to try and struggle in the future move back. 

So Back at the top Iowa. That one step, one of the cultists is now going to get some gumption and is going to run forward in the strike it helios as well. This is going to be really bad. She says he's about to That's it. 

Anyway, I'm going to, I will bonus action. I will even work by then. 69, That'd be a pretty big hill. Two ones. You couldn't technically get it to work. If you're coming, total healing, you If you tested it like an 8th or 9th level and then when it but it just be kind of fun. 

I will use my action to. I can't believe. I will cast Maze, Man. Okay, just have that one. Oh no. Space. Thanks, beautiful. Okay, make a dictionary. Check Just because there's a lot of bodies. 

Let me just please give me. They all talk Is the one the first one or the second one. All right, so the 20 hits, the not one doesn't But that one will do something. Typically magical weapon 10%. Yeah, so with a knot one, okay, what do you do with an apple? 

Yeah, you actually Pierce helios with your not one damage Doesn't even have to roll to hit for him to hit everything. I mean even if it's not like he's stabbing out and like just losing the whip, it was one I can't do what I want to do. Still defender. 

20 Friday. 

Anything else. All right, It is the other cultists turn. He is going to rush forward. Okay, Catholic. I forgot once again to do this, but you have, you have now seen the Sea Hag so you need to make a will save a wisdom tapes. ... Keep forgetting that instantly upon sea. 

12, You just succeed, You are safe from it for that. So the other all this runs off and is going to attack. Not the aspect of the blue dragonfly. Okay. So with disadvantage That's definitely not going to hit me. That's a 17. Videos. All right, I will take one stab at the wounded soldier. 

Okay, I think it's thunder some shatters. Under ThunderCats. Oh, So at 9 pierson damage from the spear stab. It was the one that's alive, this this guy. Yep. Because the most explodes he has to make a concert within 5. Ft of the, I don't think so. I don't know, like wherever they do. 

Sorry. If he was, he was in between the two of them, right? The one that's closer to Helios got in that one, the other one got a 2016. You're on a 20 on it. I'll go ahead and make my second attack against the the little boy called us in front of me. 

And then I'm going to go. I'm going to steal or try to probably not. That is an 11 is the higher I could do. 

Already it helps you move. And by in the doorways. Yeah. And in the doorway a little bit. Okay. Yeah. Okay We go again. Is going to use a reaction to call upon syndrome. So your attack yesterday. Right now, he's literally been there. 

Why you want to see if I can use AI to scale it up? Even in the real map, it doesn't look like the grid lines. Are that visible? Well no they definitely are. I mean I can see him from here on the funny monitor. So funny What? What? He's fighting for? 

Wait, he's fighting for the Oracle. You mean? He's a good guy? He's a warlock roblox. Can't be good. Is it above or not? Units. That's mean. You're the only one that understands what is set. There's almost like a sudden clap of thunder. And you hear in. What sounds like a very disappointed. 

Angry voice. This is your punch. For your cruelties upon my spot. And the eldered blast blasts into the sea. Hag blasting through from front to back out as she falls down. Okay. The only thing I would say is like, I know by now, this is something holding or, right? 

Or yes, you can clearly see the creature. Some kind of creature apparently made of water, right? That is holding. And now that you're up closer, you do recognize the deal. Okay, I'll just go ahead and do my most active booting, my head to the water elemental with the spring thing as well. 

Okay, Just don't know anything What happened. So I'm going to move in. I'll go all the way in. How much is a yoga 25? Get them. I got it.

Yeah, you didn't seen this. 

For the record. It looks like this. 

I want to touch it. Okay, any attempt to To an attempt to like make a ticket lost. It's grip. I'm going to cast silent image. I'm going to make an image of the Oracle. This is going to be just like something that I can this is going to make any sense of it.

You stab the door. I bet you didn't see that coming. Wow, we have fun here. Four piercing two railings. 

All right. Okay, Julio's, That's me. I'm just going to walk up and attack the Saunter if you will hear that, the Oracle is attempting to say things to you. She's also attempting to yell at you. Hey man. 

Oh, that is 22 damage. That is 15, 15, 15 minutes. What happens to the oracle water? In the beauty of the nearest, or What is John that? Wait a minute. With a canon. What happens if you said this time? It's funny. I'm just going with a regular if I can find something. 

Maybe is it working that library of random? Magical effects? One was 1.22. Actually has stuff like nearest pallets. 2160. 2015. 

What the duck 41. You are now the God. 

So I'm doing the one that I find funnier, Of course, for you any attack on, you has a 2% chance to instantly kill you. Okay, so far Doesn't like congeal like it normally does and a puff of smoke comes out and you watch as all of the armor and all of the, like things that the oracle is wearing turns to that way. 

Spread eagle in the air. Are you turning old man? Why Don't Why? Sweetheart. We have a job please, You can tell she is not looking at any of you. There is a like, a noticeable life blush, starting from embarrassment. These. It was either with you 26346. Don't know if it's going to work but I'm going to fucking try it. 

Anyway, We're going to do a fire spell. Okay, to the water. Congratulations. The water helped, weird is now boiling. And now burning it. 19 to hit. Do I actually do damage. No. Okay, Your fire spell hits the hits. The the water weird fizzles out and you just care. Why Why? 

Anything else that'll do. I'm going to try to punch it. 

Eight, It does not hurt. Okay. 

21 minutes. 9, I'm blessed. 

I have fucking dammit. She spell. Yes, you do talk at the death. This is my career. You can be there here. That saved me. 

Okay. 8 damage, You're always wetter as you say these things to it and then it first like a lot of balloons. The Oracle how high up in the air will show you pretty much as high as the water. Weird could hold her, okay. Would I be able to? And since I'm in Bayway as a reaction try to get under an picture, I will attempt to do so. 

All right, make a 

I mean, could I help Cuz I'm there as a mailer? I, as a reaction, could I just better fall on her? I do that is to take me to the easiest thing to do if you want to try and catch her athletics. Yeah, I'm just yeah, I'm just going to do that and it's more amusing this way. 

I got 12 so he left you and I were immediately rushed forward kind of trying to like Like almost fire getting right to like fireman catch as she starts to fall, you just hear Merrick and you now see the oracle is slowly drifting down and is just I really hate this. 

You really hate this song. I mean she would probably still get to the ground pretty quick. I know. But like, as she's slowly falling. What are you doing now? I was going to try to do that. No, what do her clothes look like? You're going to be like, I guess I can't move. 

Yeah, I can't move. It's not moving on her skin up here. Immediately grab some of the the bedspread on the bed behind her and immediately like wraps it around herself. 

Thank you. 

What was all that about? Then They're trying to kill you. Thank you. For freeing me from the hatred is very important. I'll do somewhere to him. Warm activity. 

Pleasure to meet you in person. And welcome guests to our land and I will be in Maryland. Dance your question, Eric? No. This and she kicks the courts of the sea hack, she walks over and kicks it. Patriot was not sent here to him in my life, She reaches down kind of rifle through and pulls out. 

What looks to be a folded piece of paper that you unfortunately, You know, the secret ways, through the forbidden, sea to the cave, where my daughter dwells Find her and bring her to practice unharmed. And I will release you from the your own What was the name of the first helicopter? 

This sea, hag. Made a note to my friend. But that's not particularly fought. Well, something that I saw recently. And he bits me come back. However, I don't I don't much care for what he cut. So, he sent this to bring me back. And while does he have coupons and harm me directly? 

You didn't have ways. And she looks at the oracle the the acts bought. And she bets down and kind of wipes away the blood from the neck. 

Shall we return to the top of the? Are you injured? I, She looks a cat who recently healed the stab wound that he inflicted. I am quite healthy. Thank you, baby. I am a little confused as to 

But when we get to the offer levels, I can get some replacement garments. 

I know that's fate works in mysterious ways. Sometimes they'll find what? Isn't this a bit much? If you wanted to see me, All you had to do was ask. And she turns and starts to walk past all of you and starts to slap the older gentleman away as she does. 

As she does, she goes 

Come. Now I know you're much more bigger than that. You have much more vigor in you than that? Come on. Blessing. Immediately beat. Oops, I will find them and I will. 

Accident worked over balboa. It's nothing that cannot be device. You want pipes? Thank you. Thank you, Please. After you and he like tries to usher the Oracle to the side to like have you all go first I start walking after walking back the way we came. Already you make your way back up to the upper level. 

And as you make your way back towards the statue, proteus and the oracle diverge of making their way back to that secondary set of rooms. As you reconvene, you see Korea there kind of looks up. The other lights have been seeming to take care of disposing. The corpses, You can see clear light blood trails of the corpses being moved outside of the temple. 

Good. I assuming based on the fact that you are returning that you manage to find her. Yes. We did the best We did all that we could do. Good. Well, sleeping. What do you bounce artists? I'm more than that. You just see her from a moment like Well, that must have been quite a spectacle. 

Quite the best phone As you turn around, you watch a produce coming out with the Oracle redressed in similar clothing that she wants had real quick describing the care of what happened. I do want to tell her the first thing I guess I'm going to say in Celestial is I presume, you know, this language Yes, I will then reweigh the message that I since I was the only one that heard it that I heard when the Sea Hag was this morning. 

I get the feeling that you weren't in the room though, which is probably why you didn't hear, So, you would understand me telling her, but I was the only one in the room with you. I had to, I would guess that she attempted to call on Citron for 8, but judging on the description that you're giving me, I'm assuming that's it going to take issue with her. 

Perhaps. More words that I figured would be good for you to know. That is interesting. It is at this point that proteus and urical step out from The bathrooms and carriages. Good. You did indeed. Rescue. The Oracle steps over. I say thank you. The rescue and yay that you have given it. 

He's fine. People that stay here and attend me. Thank you for what you done. There's much that we need to discuss. She takes a deep breath. She stares at you. YouTube, your eyes probing, your souls with your penetrating gaze. And eventually she says You warn her who stand here. 

Gather, We'll be tested. The Saints have revealed three great paths, that must be accomplished before. You are ready to sail into the three seas. Titans You must shake the silver fires or lost forge or just to crack the tools that you will need. You must claim the mighty weapon in New York against the Titans by the first dragon world. 

You must drink deep from the bottomless dragon horn. There will reveal a vision that I cannot see but low onto the for I have seen the end of all things. My father's anger cannot speak well, and his sister schemes. Even now Request may yet fail, and if it should, the sky will rain in black fire and the doing the private As she pauses, the kind of light that was like starting started to providing in her eyes and eventually begins to fade going back to the normal color. 

She kind of staggers a little bit produce, kind of helps her off and in a brief in the brief pause. Korea goes. That is not something most people get to see. 

Again. I say thank you for what you have done. 

Take my words that I just spoke to her. Those were deep issue. I have a few other ones before I must rest. Words that I should speak to some of you. This can be done. In private. Should you so desire or can be done here? It is up to you. 

I've never been here before. I don't know. Just She sent me a letter. Yes, Yes. You've done many crazy things in your time in. Yeah, true love strain. I would. Any great things with already done, but I see you understand. I would recommend you seek out your phone. There are many things to say, You and me must talk about Seat python out.

I know the rock sounds. I see a snow. In the shape of a shooting star. 

It is quite near one of these tasks that you must complet. See another one. In the shape of a heart. 

Do not know what's exact location, but I fear that it might be in the possession. 

I do not know what these stones are and I do know what they are to you, but I know that they are important. And I would caution you. Wearing your journey. Do not blindly see them, the be cautious for a sense. Why there is much food to come from them, please? 

Sinister and Deadpool. 

Precautious. Hope you find what you are. Happy.

And they are sitting away. Should you designer to leave this thing? You proofread that Anything should be. 

Much even. 

Okay. 

A terrible thing has been put upon your shoulders. Terrible thing is happening to ones who 

Temple thing. 

I believe that, you know, some of this already. As fate has washed over you. Bad words. 

I'm serious. Still wants your life. And why your faith has granted you within protected, you? I feel that there is a shift happening. Cannot exp. 

Faints in this to be shifted, really weather for good or even I'm just done many great things. You don't know what you have anymore. Do not let that mark. Where you down, You have voice in about. 

Eventually, you will be free from that. 

13\. 

Why Why Why you doing this? Why? 

I know that you're happy now. I know that you have your work. About being called this past. I know that you look to some of those around you. Do you think yourself is You're not a warrior who charges headlong into battle with a sword from So much going to happen. 

So many things can be done from somebody. That's a difference of perspective. 

A man who has something. I had two very dear. Someone waiting. Can do great things. 

I know that you're also worried. 

Because so, They step on you and To see, you know, steel away something. So The gift is. There may be a way. To not give up your talent for music to bring light to the world through song. 

I would. You seek out. Man demo. 

He is a guard up in the of the necropolis at Tylenol. 

He has answers about this course that have been put upon you in life. I would. Recommend caution. Unfortunately. Which is like him. 

She's about good spirit. All it takes is for one person to To change. 

You seek your maker? And I can understand why. You still bringing your life. And bringing you being 

There's great bond between two of you, but I cautioned it. The makers went alive. But he seats. Receipts to be free and for you to be free. A terrible fate upon. He is destined since destroy what he's made. I unfortunately translate. Faith team that you will be destroyed by him. 

He does not want to do that. He seeks your way to be free. It used to be all more, all the food designed. 

Sheep away from you, too. 

I would caution see him now too soon. I do not know how when you look mad or this ill-fate may come upon us with you. I've actually your password cross. And I pray that in that time, you both will be able to stand up. 

But as with everybody here, You paid the power to change that. Power of the God's items do not. 

The Power of Motors is great and best. 

And she kind of slumps a little bit as a produce kind of Expended quite 

And it starts to leave her away. Before they get. Out the doors into the bathroom. 

Cara. Yeah, I asked why you continue the trade? And watches Korea steps forward changing and visits becoming slightly younger, the long blonde hair. You shrinks into a short black hair and you specifically, as a barred immediately recognize this as Cara. Oh yeah, the gospel music. 

There's no such there's no wrong. Making oneself. Look like somebody else. That's fair. But if you show desire to help these heroes, there's no reason for such a trivial appointment for No, I would want. Again. You must be careful and what you do. 

I can see that while fates do change. You want something real actions? 

Of course, I know that we must be careful when our waiting for any time is working. We need not for my team. I know exactly. Where am I locations? But I will not stop. I will not rest. Bother our things, people to say things to be done. I will act as I see them. 

Can I expected you to? I heard that you were ready for the consequences. Should you overstep? I'm at that produce leads the article into the background. You watching this, the revealed horror kind of takes a seat Kind of winded a little bit by the looks of her. 

That was a lot. I'll do it. Yeah, first time singer is Michelle. Pleasure to make your acquaintances official. 

I knew only the only, I they go. That's Draw, such a negative before. 

All right, that's cool. 

I I do apologize but sometimes it's better to walk around cooking me different. I hope you understand. Of course I've ever done that. Interesting though. 

Sometimes it is necessary to take on a guy's, not your own. Yeah, interesting. I never considered it. 

Yes, she is right along with it but it was almost always No, I shouldn't say almost, It's always important. 

At Atariska sounded naive hair. Who is the Oracle's father? She said, baby. She mentioned though, I'd suppose if you're not as familiar with the history of this world, as we are, their father is sitting around. 

Masters. Very interesting. Not somebody, we want necessarily to annoy and we have to cross three, oceans. Well, remember why we crossed the ocean? Indeed. 

This is all new to me here. I'm just trying to piece it up. See how this all fits Seems like everything's interconnected. 

Especially gods seems like. Certainly seems like this whole Oracle business seems to be real real enough to me. 

Bit of an odd way to phrase it though. I suppose you are not from around here. I guess you could say that. I'm from the Greenfields of the Eyre. Get said that I've heard of it though. Not that I would expect to I survived as much Also, you've been there. 

That's very interesting. Then you must know the songs of my people too. 

Well, we'll have to we'll have to show everybody else. Some of that sometimes Going to say Mary gets a woman to pay one size, dancing on beverage. I guess I'll say that in character. I'd start dancing right now to a jig but it's, it's been a pretty long day so far. 

Think we all have things to think about how long it actually been. It has to be pretty morning. We'll probably looking at, like, 12:40, Especially since battle takes, right? There's been a lot of walking like getting vacations and talking about, 

Will you be continuing to join us, Well, to be perfectly honest. I would love to be able to come up with. I have a first-hand account, so, Tail, the heroes fighting against. And help. However, small way, I Yes. Unfortunately lit, other than offer advice. Becoming more involved is 

Danger. 

I'm assuming that has to do with the what the oracle is talking about. . It's a short history. Especially for those swimming. Interesting. There was more between. The type and the people. The Dragon Balls. Help the scale back in favor of Marvels. But even with that, there was only so much they could do. 

That's what he is Myself. My sister, my brother, my father. 

Want him to preserve for life here. Not seeing 

But I won't deny. Very powerful. So, I'm most similar problems. The beasts creatures, they like vegans. Monsters. Conflict was long. Taxing. Bloody And ended in the death of Michael. Not as interests. 

Wild battle continued. 

Fake interjected. Was immediately between us and Titans. And created. A packed piece. An agreement. Agreement, that has lasted for 500 years. Agreement. That's Why literally prevents me from taking direct action. Against that. And agreement, she turns and you can see these markings. Now they they seem to not be there but like there's a bit of shimmering to her visage and you now see the blood red markings on her face stretching down eventually fade like right about here. 

And that person that's what we had. Seen once up early, What? I figured It's kind of an intricate design Breaking. The pack of peace is not something. I am physically capable of here. However, at a point at what point in time, Simply saving the lives and she gestures to the acts who have now come up and their brain life bedding. 

Pillows, cushions to you and kind of like setting them for you to use and then like politely bowing and trying to give you space in this position of the temple. Originally just helping innocent bystanders would not be. But it seems as the agreement. 

I don't know, It seems as though the fates and That's agreeing with his changed. Any more direct influence rule? 

I won't be around. I'll send your baby. So, I cannot Take direct app and I must be careful how I act from that one. I publicize. Communications. I thank you for your help as far. 

As I said, I truly do want to do anything and everything, I can to keep keep those. Wiping out everything that I told you. 

So yes, I would very much like to join. And helping, whatever way I can. If there are other things that are better suited to my talents, I will, of course, But almost Three tasks that you are. 

I think we should probably discuss that. At least, after everybody looks at pics of, she kind of looks over some of you a little bit more deliberately and looks at the injur, Have said something we couldn't do. I have a number of ideas but I want to do something. 

Hey baby, unrelated. Question, did you have time? 

Being as quick as I am, I have quite a few Well, if it's not everyday, you get to speak with the mistress of music, How would you incarnate yourself? So I was, I will ask you if you have heard about your song creation I haven't. Studying, that's for most of my life and I think there might be more than You're very good. 

I have heard. And I can't tell you that. 

Well, I think I feel like I knew that I play a couple of notes too. Do you know what, if I can find any more of it or The song of creation. 

Ask part of the Has been divided. Fitbit's song of its store was given to each. Individual. That was a part of the 

My part you already know because I gave it to you quite a while. 

I don't know if it's about two. Started fruition. I did not know that I know. But the other piece is, I know for a fact that my father has one, I know for a fact that my sister, 

Dallas also has one. 

I would dare say that if he hasn't lost it. Destroyed somehow and high blood probably has. 

I'm just saying. Of a dimmable. Yes, I didn't capitalize. 

I have my theories. I don't quite know. Well, this is invaluable for the last 30 years trying to find something Give me three names. This is incredible. I think you My news and every problem, But whatever they would do to her, she is an odd and a smile. 

If you excuse me there are a couple of things I want to look into. I will leave you to recovering. As I do not need to offend a few of you look like, you could very much use If he stands up stretches a bit. Kind of gives a flourishing bowel stance up and is gone and there's almost like Not like, And as you look, you can actually see the stone where she was standing. 

There's a bit of an indentation, as though, like her legs. And then you see a bit of movement where you can, like there were a couple of footsteps that were so, like pressed hard that they actually left a bit of footprint, 

Once she's going here later, she's going to take a walk outside too cuz that's why I want to camp. 

Right after you watch it. Did you go to music around? I'm going to look for a nice spot and sit down. Okay. Easy enough to find a little out. Proper rock. Then makes a good seat. I'm going to. The start a little little fire and just start taking a little rest. 

All righty, Helio says, she takes around you, see Merritt, walk outside and start talking a little spot. What about the rest of you? So went outside, I'm just probably just sitting down with steps. 

Warming around the temple, taking it in. You have so much of the act, the lights, they all give a very respectful like ball to you a word of thanks for saving their lady for protecting projeus, as he's a bit. Devoted to the point of foolishness, sometimes. Okay, I'm just going to be wandering around. 

Trying to get. And if they have like that or something, they're setting up on it, they continue to kind of set up a status space with some, they don't look like the best beds. They're definitely like spare sleeping arrangements that they probably have that. They bring out and continue to set up section of where you were previously sitting. 

Then if they're doing that then I'll probably stay in here. Yeah. Using what they got already provided Then I'll probably just like go to like a meditative thing. If we are going to like do a short rest then come on double check something back please. It's got like a mile range. 

So what I'd like to do is like kind of like out where we were traveling, right? I kind of just want to see if there's anything happening on that. At the land that we were just kind of, like, seeing right, what's going on? Just kind of being aware things moving around, As you start to see, you do see, a number of things. 

The first thing that catches your eye is, you see cars standing in a tree, like, It seems so arms crossed over Verizon. 

Kind of nods to herself. And then immediately like, Just like practically running through the air in a direction. 

Seemingly from your current perspective. Seemingly heading west. Okay. And like it's practically like a blank and she's just right, right? I just see. Okay. 

Greek themed meditative type stuff. I still like that. I like this image in my head now like you you all are just like meditating. He's like I'm just like somebody's redneck dad. That's just like hey guys. Hilo. I took it, he was walking around in a deep contemplative thing. 

Oh, there are other definitely some of them but most of them I'm sure is just for undergraduate. Particular soul loser. He didn't get too far though, I'm here. So He got that one stabbing in the back and there was immediately shocked. He's a restaurant with that has a good half of that. 

Right now. Question, why didn't you recognize your own? Difference. They couldn't come up with a better disguise, I mean, maybe maybe that's the point where it's like it is this who we think it is and then the reveal and all it is that we think Yes, I am your president Bojidan. 

Come on, man. Hello friends. Bill Clinton. 

It's not hard to sew back a button. Call him sleep. Well. Of course, it's only because his name was Bill. No other potential reason. I do it later. Okay, about 19 minutes. I am the renowned architect and president of Long Fence Donald Trump. 

Turn the record. It's actually the fact that the book legally describes her, as not, taking that much time and effort into her disguises. So it's like, yeah, she uses the magic to change her appearance but it's like we. All right. What's your name? What's your name? Hi, my name is Cadine. 

What's your name? What kind of work best musician in Fallout? The morning comes to you, You all wake up in your various places of wherever you went to sleep. Eric, I'm assuming you were outside. No, he was going to go back inside. And you see at the top of the stairs, you see. 

Well, come awake. Those of you inside the temple, many of the acolytes are coming up to you with plates of fruits and vegetables. One of them does We are preparing something a bit more parking. Of course, in this most, you're much obliged. Properly. Sperry's background. Do you come up with Arizona? 

Have a quick question. I don't know if I have selected. Who is the statue of? That is clearly decided. No, he's got bull water. Anyway, I tried out my Poseidon. Poseidon eventually comes out seems to be dressed a little bit different, as kind of like a cooking smock on asks what each person would like for their more. 

Hearty breakfast. Pretty much everything you ask is seems to be a very well supplied place. So the food is brought out to your request without too much issues. I want warm cereal Rare steak, almost all of your I did not and understand what they meant by I was counting on it. 

New York. 

No, they boil the goats. I sure eating your breakfast. You hear a distinct life. And then you see Cara walking through like walking between moving like 100 feet per pound. Police are in the book. You got multiply that like You see her coming round and she seems to be eating what looks like an apple that you got from somewhere else right now. 

It's from real yet. Real Greek mythology. The guys at Discord Paris. Like it's literally in the back of the book like near infinite amount of speed. She's literally like the flasher It sure does eating breakfast. Ramakov. 

Phil is right. His rain. Thank you very much. I hope some sleep. Did you? So I'm good as well. Assuming usually. I do, I can. I mean you saw that? Yeah. I wasn't awake to actually look. That's it. Well. Between you and me. I did little thinking. And out of the three things that she spoke of I would recommend that you start by going to us. 

Sorry parts. Do we have to cross any large bodies of water to get there? I'm not your location. Except every one of the closest cities, I like it. I've always wanted to see you still Hi. Jeff. Are you? Well, you know, it has to be cool. It's where I'm from. 

What was it? Like to run up there? 

Was trying to think of something. I could relate it to but nothing you would understand. I suppose, since you're not also from here, that's true. Interesting, I guess I'll find out when we get there. You can show us around. From the days before the pack of peace. Very interesting came from something similar myself. 

That's why I'm out here, adventuring Hi Thor. This was a joke. 

You don't understand. I'm assuming he looks nothing like me. Correct assumption. I'm assuming he looks something like him. 

Yes, but he's going to get bigger. 

I still have quite a bit to grow into. Why did you say I know or I doubt it. 

I'm almost 30. 

I don't think. YouTube, I've seen Other people like you. What do you mean? 

What do you mean? I'm just a short human. I see. 

There are shoes but and you're not a particulate. You can't immediately appointment on the hostage fee. Feel weird. I like that. 30 is. What up, sir? I don't know. For human. It is. All right. This is Ancient. 

That sounded much more useful in my Which one? Bob. I mean, would it be maybe not common knowledge is the right phrase? But for those of us that are there would we know the relative locations of the things that the orbitals said Yeah, you might just particular things maybe cuz I met the player didn't recognize anything but Helios if there's one in a story Vulcan Street words. 

Make a history. Check make a history. Check. Yeah I took out the make a history. Check less for like reading up on history. You've it's about reading up on history and you're in your creator making you use because you live there US because you travel around a lot also had some of that. 

Yeah back there but yeah. Question would agent Greek things like Hercules or anything like that? If it's a Thelios Not sorry. Ancient heroes have likely traveled to other worlds. I didn't want to talking about that. No, not happening. Thinking about what was said, about shaping the silver fires of the lost four, That immediately makes you think. 

Of the mythful. The missile Forge being an ancient forge that Vulcan did construct. And thinking about it, you know, for a fact that there is a there's a clan of dwarfs that live in Astoria. That's, Or either descendants of Midville Ford workers or literally were worse that worked and you know that they live in a store. 

Based on the knowledge that was imparted to you on your construction. What is wrong? Odd? Not 

That's not great. Are you actually? 

You would know if I, That there is an item. That does sound similar to this dragon form. That they are the spoko. That is supposedly held somewhere in a story. 

But, You now know for a fact that the king of the story is your father. That is true. What is your role 

Holy Hercules. 

As I was saying, I think one of our best starting points would be a story. I think that's a great idea. Let's head out. I appreciate the devotion. Don't forget. Never be bound down yesterday. The preciously. Musical spiritual. 

And we get to see your father, 

As you all know, gather your things you do here. One moment, please. As the representative of the acolytes that live here, I give my deepest, thanks for all that. You have done for us. For her age. Peace off. Please accept these happy. Holds what appears to be like a small box and inside that you see, six small glass, like flats. 

We've kind of a bright reddish liquid. Except these with arm. Butthole. This is the best that we could do. Once these are the best potions of healing. Please take it with our 

Thank you, kindly. I could be using that. 

The future of Thailand, maybe. But there is always. The people of this lab will look to your actions. As a sign of thinking. We have to save them. Neither thing nor fortune. Make yourself, see he can apply. You need to vows and as he leads a car underneath swollen. 

I agree with a lot of what he Butts about. A cautions about not seeking. Thing. And to be fair, those being the ultimate man. Famous fortune. Tell. I would suggest that chance to win something. Young. You're expected. Do this. Persuade people. Bring them to ourselves and to see that while these dark time. 

Or opponents, even they 

Well, I do. Strongly. Opportunity to make your name. There is one time. The tricky thing about that. Is if you're not careful. I'm here at Mike's outside the others. Then all the stories. We get about the one hero. Now strong and valiant they are Not exactly truthful. I understand. 

The rest of you are yesterday's. So, I encourage you. Swear. No. This is a secret that will find you together in the spirit of self interview. One of you, Wednesday. All of your shit at, who knows? That's the magic of the Earth or even protect you against some of the dangers that I had. 

Going and braids. No, it's very, very 

To fellowship. 

As she says, this is not to be taken. You will crystal or worse. Most likely works. Of course, it is always wise to heat the advice of a goddess, but As my fellows here that are from dialect. No. And as they say, I know there's not to be taken lately. 

As you saw with the The witch of Sidra on. The letter, you read The oath, she gave to syndrome. She had to do whatever he asked. To the point of she would have died. Had she refused. I'm very interested. 

That is enough. Great thing that can be used and ate one another. But that must be taken in solidarity. And should you so design? 

I have no issues with such, but like to think one exactly how I want to approach it. Yes. Baby, you know, just a couple days ago. I'm here temple of your goal. Same means of the Just go to something here. But we don't have a Facebook. 

Figure out the details to be honest. I was kind of wanted something. 

Just that. 

I can reach you, Maybe we should do it but we should figure it out because right. I'm about to get it by noon. It's crazy game. She holds out a paper that she was scrolling on. I'm on this paper, you read. I am. Parentheses insert, man. And I swear upon my life and my honor that I will uphold the oath of friendship with the warriors, who stand at my side. 

Nobody agree. You certainly have a way with words. 

Same way go ahead and start making our way towards the store yet I'm thinking this to come get away. And same direction as the sour. Or is it the opposite direction? It is West from your current location. The shower vintage is. Up out of the crater. Back on to the top. 

You see the sun rising as it as it's still? Well if it's not rising anymore it's probably about that. You see the sun is shining bright summer day? Start your way westward gorgeous. And we'll pick up there next time. 

Are you prettier?
