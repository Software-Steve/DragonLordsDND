Ira, and Mary, both lost their memories who they were, where they were, why they were here. And helios was rendered. 

Cara not exactly knowing what was happening or how to handle it was attempting to determine what was the cause of this sudden strange occurrence. You coming that this was a person. I'm worried because there was not much he was able to do. Fortunately Khaled was able to provide the necessary skill with a lesser respiration Though. 

Time was needed. While you waited for the time that it took for Cali to make the necessary preparations, There was A sudden action of good fortune cast by Merrick in his not exactly most kosher state But sensing that mischief might be a foot helios and being out in search. 

What this mission might be Finding a number of cedron. Cultists seemingly be attempting to make their way towards your camp to strike in the night. Seemingly way late by some cast of ill-fortune as a tree had been Aged decade and toppled on top of them, killing all. But one, A strange bit of flock. 

Making your way back you explained as best you could Helios to Cara. Situation. Sending that there was no further. Difficulty transpiring that night, you all rested Khalid was able to make his necessary preparations and wanted a time, he removed the effects of the madness from each of you. Though not removing the memories for some of you love. 

The actions or what was set. You woke up fully rested the next day, and after some awkward conversation and deliberately ignored queries, You set off Once again, making your way towards a story. Finding yourselves at the top of a hill where you were able to see the itself. See that it is settled, that it see that it is nestled in between the cliffs of a rocky gorge. 

You see that, the north wall of the town is part of a stone fortress that protrudes from the town, from any danger that might come from its house housing, caverns, and shops of all kinds straw out from the forecast. Feeling much of the gore. The Northern Mall seems to be defended by Allegiant soldiers that you can specifically make out. 

You are still a member of miles away but just due to the massive number of these soldiers. You can tell that that is gone. While the southern gate seems to admit a steady stream of what appears to be travelers and mercy characters. That is where we pick Pick up tonight. 

What a beautiful sight. Worse. What I wash city. All right. That was like halfway there, It was the wrong keyword, but it was there. 

You think that's training or phone? I would say more guarding cuz I assume that they've been here. Usually considered the most vulnerable to the fact that from the north is where much of the centaur and cyclops they want to do a tech. That's the way they would come from is almost always has a permanent defensive posture there, the height, the level of like awareness varies but they always have a spring. 

This is a bit of a peculiar site to you because you've never seen the Garrison seemingly to be at such a high. You can tell that they are not, but you can see, just based on the positioning, the positioning in this, the size of this. You gather based on the fact that you've seen 20 people out there. 

Okay. So yeah, we're boarding that back to answer. I almost called you but healthy is not unusual. The legion always has a presence on the northern side of the city though. I've never seen such a large presence if I'm being honest. Okay. 

Well, it seems like more than just the gods are getting ready for this oath to come to an end then Well, yes, certainly perhaps we should seek audience with your father as soon as possible, then Well, I think that was the plan anyway but yes, I'm sure if this much of the legion is out. 

He is certainly aware of the circumstance. 

Also, you should take into sites, you know, new new place, new boy. 

What do you have? Never seen the story before. 

Miles away. Yeah obviously look at what people are coming more like on a more wild travel path. At this point, Cara has linked up with the road that leads towards the southern entrance and you can see you're coming up towards Approaching the city from the south, You encounter a carrot, You actually do see them there, making the quickest. 

You actually overtake them before too long. And you can see that. These are. Not good, looking animals. Few heard of oxen that these what you gather to be farmers for, like a better term. They are maciated. They are Not sickly looking but they definitely look malnourished to the point that anymore when he comes sickness. 

And And they the the travelers themselves look. Dirty higher. Some of their clothing. Just kind of seems to be in tatters just through like use and not really taking the time to like repair them and not been like in pristine conditions. And as you come up, they kind of 

Morning. 

Catch up. 

Where they're from. 

You've done nothing. Other than apparently, been put onto the The hire strong. 

The temples here, must maybe. 

Those who cannot their punished. As you can see any gestures. I need help. 

We know. Well, the The Eye of Silence. 

Strang. I feel the right, you do? I forgot to mention this? But you do see that carrot does not look like she normally does she has once again got changed. 35, roughly kind of light, flaming orange, red hair. Like an older version. How she normally looks but like different skin tone, kind of more of a darker tan, like, very sunny, just 

And at this point, the other one of those. 

Don't know what you're saying. 

Strange. 

Not on timely but like, in a very suspicious like this, Almost beaten down way like starts to posture the auction a little bit farther, but the roads only so big. So they get about maybe like 10 feet. Like, take the hint in half feet up a little bit. Catch you next time. 

Continue. As you start to pull away, the first one goes, Just as a warning. Should you be in the area? Be careful of the Santa's the same boxes, Their activity has been increasing the plant, They attach travels and you kind of hear the other one though. My father, explain. 

Hush is no reason to not be civil. Thank you. Thank you for the warning. Good luck in your tryouts. You as well. 

All right, I have not been here before videos. Do you know, if he said to like the fire, I mean Kingsbury is other than metaphor or is it at 12 weeks or so metaphorical? That is does I believe Garrett said, one of our main purposes in being here? 

There's three, there's four games. Hey, I don't know what's going to kill you. This quoting it by saying the fire under the under the king is bad. 

Yeah, I assume it's a very similar meaning. Yes, I think that is has a, I believe. Kyra is said, one of our main purposes in being here is to Leading the king towards action. So, it's French. I thought I was you. How we might do that. I suppose I suppose we'll have to talk to him. 

I mean, it probably wouldn't hurt if we had something to show our efforts. I just imagine that I just fucking don't know. Yes, it Would certainly not be bad to have. Something a bit more concrete than words. I've been doing a bit of thinking, but I'm, fortunately, if not really come up with much. 

At this current point in time. 

I mean, we are the chosen ones. I don't know if Helios will care about that or not Certainly I do care. Hope we can try the trial stuff. That I think would be a good step forward. The dragon. Especially have something smaller. Stirrup. So like full cavity surgical like there, but it's not like every single word. 

Paying attention. Now, you see that she has a very kind of distant 

What, sorry, what was that? Any ideas on how to arouse the king? I have a simple. None of them are good ideas. Propagating. The. 

Most likely, what's going to happen? Is that You all should take the speaking role in this conversation with my brother. I Don't think. A conversation between the two of us would Be as next and it's your turn as the guards, they turn to you. They look and Welcome, please. 

What are your names and your business? Any the one speaking is kind of like a lieutenant based on the armor You recognize this as the armor garb, simples of foie tent Hey, there's other story of returning home. I told you and one of the others actually, I told you that was Helios. 

I saw him fight. I saw him fight against Barrow, the battleham. And the lieutenant just kind of. 

Welcome back. Thank you, Are, these are traveling companions of mine. I've opened 11 introduce themselves. They are with me and my arm trusted acquaintances. Here, that was something. And you are. I got him looking. Welcome out there of your exports. 

I'll step forward, I will say. No bowel. Do they do that? He's going to inclines his head. Calico before clients. Little bit. I've been looks very. Like you walking visibly as he looks at both. You American and Ira and his head. How do you do? I'm Eric Ellis 

I'm Ira from And it is persuasion with that safe. 

Okay, I'll see how this goes first before I try to open it here. I assume that while it is not a common thing at all most people, especially able to lieutenant, status would probably know that there are people that just like get shipped right from other places they do. 

So there are varying degrees of how they respond to that That's fair but that's the only thing I really got Being that many tars are commonly from the north year. Yeah I will just explain to the lieutenant whether she is from Metro or not. I do not. Truly know. 

I know that she is. One of the shipwrecked from another place. So she is, I've never affiliation with syndrome. And I can bounce personally that she has told a number, like, his father's relationship with advantage because of who you are, Well, that is cocked. All right, that is 8:00. 

Score because he needs to give you lovers. You actually as you're talking you can see that he's like he's listening to you, right? He's not exactly immediately believing but you see that. Like as he looks at everybody, again, almost seems to be like looking at everybody taking in their appearances. 

Seemingly thinking about what he just heard You almost see like like when somebody has like that light bulb moment kind of it's not as pronounced but there's definitely a Like, I kind of an eye like slight opening. 

Heat gestures to one of the others leans in and whispers something to another, a lower ranking soldier, Anybody that wants to make perception. Check to see if you hear what he whispers. I suppose, I'll try since I'm probably standing fairly close to them not uncomfortably close up. 

Go get the cat. And immediately, this older runs off. 

Please. Welcome to the store. Thank you lieutenant and thank you for your service to the city. And thank you for your service to this last 

No proceed. Yes. Start to walk in and we tended immediately start you only immediately here Next. Papers, please, one of them. You get inside. And immediately, you see a large section of the city there are shops on either side, kind of stretching out. And at first, it looks a little haphazard and it's construction. 

But you realize that with it built basically into the the northern Sheer clip. It's designed not like a grip. It's almost designed like a semicircle Like shutting out and then like almost like wait. And it's a little strange at first, but you eventually kind of see. That's okay, that's how it's designed. 

That's the building layout, that's the order of them and it's a fairly bustling city, but there is a general sense of Not Malays per se, but it's almost like a general sense of Waiting for the second people are going about. Forward and raise talking about it. They can see just based on the way people, look, they're facial. 

Expressions, kind of an almost perpetual like bit of gloom as they go about their business. People are still seeing friendly enough, but their response and their present days as they as they pass you while polite enough. There doesn't seem to be a lot of exuberance or energy to it. 

And you don't get very far in before you see a large cloud. Starting to get And you see that it is six soldiers. One very nicely adorned on. At the front walking towards you have a crowd is kind of like turning to watch and fall not being fully sure what's happening and you hear under her breath. 

I think he knows that we're here. 

So that's the very closer. The one in kind of like a more golden armor, you can see that it is not actually gold. Some kind of Coloring gate used to make the armor appear that color. 

Welcome, my name is Captain Heights. I have been instructed to bring you to his butcher. Please do a company. Me Heroes of the Oracle. He was just to speak. Of course, and I will since I assumed from my background I would know how garments always. I will salute, you know, however you can see Welcome returns. 

My thanks Captain. If you and your companions would, of course, Right. As you continue to walk to have, you can see that people are starting to stare like as you're being left, kind of through the city, more towards the center of this kind of semicircle People are looking, people are watching and you do start to hear whispers whispers of 

And very like people's and you get this sense that The city is starting to take interest to something. There seems to be a bit more. Anticipation. What are these heroes going to do? What change are they going to? . Can you continue on? Eventually you make your way. Graham almost ostentatious. 

To. The three of you thinking about, Exactly why I would expect the god of it. I don't work, but it construct or live. It You it's all you see it. You've seen it every day. 

I said, fuck you listening. And you go through a couple of halls, and you notice that, It doesn't seem to be a lot of traffic here. You don't actually run into anybody. As you walk through the halls, You get closer and closer to these ornate doors. And as you get closer to that, everybody makes sense. 

Oh, I could see that one disappeared. Years. What sounds like somebody laughing and like scouting but not like an anger, helios you and Balthazar clearly here. This is all a large booty voice, basically going. Take that. 

And you visibly. See color. Just coming up. Like, what about just Oh God. The Captains. Be on these doors. The front room. 

I apologize for lo. And he starts to walk. I apologize, there is a non-zero chance he walked away before we entered in. I guess we'll see how the rest of the conversation goes. But if for the moment, we want to keep it on the down low that he is. 

My father I used to adventure with somebody. 

I will talk. And your current guys I presume I mean I assume he would see right through it though. Considering the fact that he doesn't. Know who his own children. You just said, a better commentary. 

I don't really know what you'll see. I guess we'll find out. El Montada, I suppose, I'll leave the way. How's it going mother fucker? 

And you make your way in and you see a large throne. But big throne all the way out the other side kind of aimless like relatively centered towards the back wall. You see I'm not a few attendance All of them are female, Of course, relative. 

I'm going to change the way I was going to say that. Various stages of adults. That is a very stage of adulthood standing all four of them, two on each side of the throne holding what it appears to be like a bottle of some kind of plate of like a couple of fruits, One of them is holding a place, the other three are also standing the side, what appear to be five statues of the five. 

You see a tall copper haired man, carrying a missile ass and a spear Who is actively fighting? He's fighting the statues. Are not there. And he continues to like swing at them and miss and then stab him, he's yelling. Haha, I have you now See what the minds are can do. 

He makes perception. He's kind of all over the place and he seems to be stumbling. 

Attracts. You hear barely audibly just here. 

Yeah, I guess I'll just for now. 

So, I'm just trying to think about the, the way that he lives with Bill about this, I guess. Where, in relation to the throne, are the statute that he's currently fighting? Is it like that? So, there isn't exactly a problem. So basically, Can I help you? You're doing it. 

This is the throne. These are the two attendants on the other side. 

Here are the five statues. With. Helio with Pythor basically. Just kind of doing that and you are all basically over here. I'm going to press the digitation the the smell of blood on one of the statues. I've had the distance actually. Oh, it's it is 10 feet down. Never mind, just start approaching. 

And then once we get to, probably about the edge of the statues, at this point, I would stop. And then more of the allowed booming for former type of voice. The Heroes of the Oracle to see, King Pythor of a story of And he actually connects and at this distance you see the one he has been primarily finding, which doesn't in fact have a number of scratches dings and not a whole lot of spectacular damage. 

But some damage that is posted and much closer. You can see he's wearing like the bottom part of a robe. And that's about it. Oh boy. That's a lot of stumble. Oracle. Welcome to my throat. Beavis and the four immediately read into exits. I would like to work at the damage on the other statues, There is equal amount of damage on his statue. 

Particularly the face. There appears to be no damage on. I specifically care about the voltage, statute primary the most damage is on pythor statue, and car statue. Car is kind of from like head to toe Pythor specifically on the head. You see very little damage on the ballast statue about some wisdom. 

You see only one strike on the Vulcan statue, but it looks like an actually powerful strike that went about halfway into the torso, and there is absolutely no strikes on the mid roasts. Fix the bulk and statue with. New. It is about like this was hit with the ax and you can see that the strike starts at the shoulder and ends about like it's so presumably that one was pure rage in the rest of them, mix of that and play fighting. 

He turns and looks at the, the disappearing attendance and he turns back to you all and goes, You are the orca. Oracle's chosen. Yes. Good. And he like seemingly kind of slumps a little bit. Let me tell you my books and he starts to make his way to his check. 

I will follow. Yeah, I'm about probably about for me up at the end of the statue. I assume probably marching order would be the same. At least getting up to it. And then if America wants to go closer, I guess that's something else I would say. Because you do notice She's got a pretty noticeable face of disgust and You see the same thing? 

And Helios sits down. Like doesn't like put them down, just drops his weapons and the rubs pretty bloodshot looking eyes. Now that you're up closer to him, He looks around. And I sways a little bit and kind of leaves closer, It goes, Apologies, I did not see. The beauties that entered my throat. 

Welcome to a store and he reaches out his hand. In your direction Ira and in cars direction, don't be shy. 

Beautiful, if you don't mind me saying, The both of you. You can almost feel like this point the anger. Yeah, that's just coming off. Okay, apologies. Where am I at? 

Anyway. My many walls, The walls that have 

I'm sorry. You didn't have a drink. 

Anyway. Sweet, lovely woman, apologies heroes of the author. 

Many terrible things have happened. To me, the city who asked you? Months. Yes. Anyway, I didn't get you a name. And he's reaching out to you and Carl again. Oh, it's Ira. I love the name. To go with my face and he reaches down to kiss your hand again. 

And there is a 

And you can see they call her just slapped him across the face and he reaches up. Iced tea. No boy. I guess not. 

What was come before a pathetic drunken pig? I wonder 

Not that much. 

I wasn't being called drunken pic. That resents being called a pic. 

You must understand that. Terrible things. Have happened to me. And so, the people that I care about, Who would that be? 

Helios has just standing added pension stone faced this whole doctor. He is Very well, concentrating on showing, no emotion, once or ever. Once again, my wife has been taken killed by the terrible dragon Hold on. What once again? Are you saying that is married? Yeah. Yes. My most recent wife love of my life. 

The mother of my dear Enora was taken one skin. My back green self. Not only that. Passed away. The men running. Bloodshot. Second twist. Truly is. Terrible things. But you're a god, Shirley you could do something about it. I could, I would I I Would show them. What the god of battle can do. 

I am. 

I thought. There. Is many things that you can do other than wallow in self-pity, you fool. And you can see that at this point, Cara has herself again. Illusion. She's dropped all of it. So you can, once again, see the red script and symbol that is covering half of her face and pythor. 

When did you get here? The whole time. You wanted to know my name so you can kiss it. Kiss my hand, just like you kissed hers against her. Will again Pythor? 

Getting yourself into someone else just so I'll touch you. 

Oh, boy. I don't know where I am in relation, but I am going to take a step like away. I imagine, you're still by the statue. Just telling everybody about the damage. You can't fix still. Yeah, you're right. 

Casting mending in vain over and over. 

Python. 

There are so many things that Besides sitting in your throne and drinking yourself into a stupor, Oh yeah, like you Oakbreaker. Look at your face. I can see his player that you've been. Been breaking it again. You better be careful, You ought to know better. That most sister that nobody crosses the fates and doesn't suffer for it, If it wasn't for those person, That's stupid oath. 

Even with Both keeps. Yeah, things can do to prepare to keep people safe, not just one but all of them. What does you know of it? Nobody loves you. You've never known. The love of another, you never known the love of a child. You I will step forward and say you are wrong. 

She is the music. 

The sucker in song s u c c o r. She is the pleasure of poetry. She is. 

Fancy words still feeling from a peaches mouth. You don't know what it's like to have the women. You love taking from you by a vile creature? You don't know what it's like to have to play Kate. 

Kiss. And And found his wishes. You just saying? We can do anything you but look at you Carl. Look at him. Yep. One more thing and you're going to be gone, I know it just look at your face. 

What do you have? No magic left? Do you have nothing to give Appreciate. 

What's up things too? If you. And car turns and starts to walk away Before she gets too far, you hear Piper kind of stands. That's why mother doesn't speak to you anymore. She speaks to us Cara but not to you. Oh, break her. And she's 

Any kind of songs back down, Looks at each of you. 

But do you have nothing else to give? Is there no magic left. No magic or fight left in yet. We could go. Defeat the dragon. 

Hello. 

Takes a deep breath. Other than that, no movement. 

Prepared for this. 

It's 

It's good to see. 

My hands are tied. I would love nothing. Then to raise my ax split the head so that dragon 

So, I know he's looking at the notes. Like this minute. To the forgotten. The split hexi's head with my arm. I would love nothing more than to spit in the eyes of Sidron and cut him in half. But my hands attached. I can't. Do with the oath, still active. 

What? I thought it was only that you couldn't intervene with mortals. No, no, I can't take action against Cedron and his People just like he can't take action against me. 

And how is it? He is taking your wife. Yes. 

She's a dragon. I don't know why. Seems to have this data against me. But she has, 

Taken every. Morgan. I 

Including, 

But, She currently lies beyond. Unfortunately. Can't leaving the city with Cedron's demands. I will not give her to him. Is she holding her daughter something? She's here, butts. Some of the followers of syndrome and to offer his demand that she be sacrificed. That she be sacrifice. On The Rock of the Storm. 

The the arctron river. 

That she be sacrificed to the best of mistakes. 

Make a perception. Check for what he's about to say Cuz this one is whispered under this 30.8. 10. 

Okay, in a auto twist of fake Helios. You in convene both here, this 

I can't. Oh boy. We could even deal with. You only need to hear, Maybe we just sacrificed you sacrifices. They're trying to get them by sacrificing the money. Fortunes has brought the heroes of the author. My doorstep. You can save my daughter. Take away this. The map. I will do whatever I can to help. 

I do have a question regarding Pythor. You mentioned states earlier in the code, We've heard mentions that the agreement has changed. Have you felt a change and that agreement? 

Yeah, I'm pretty sure. This was just covered. 

Government. 

I do know she mentioned, she is anthra but she has been instrumental in assisting us so far getting where we are. She does care for this land. 

She does. 

I apologize that you had to see. That is old. Animosity. 

Old animosity. 

I apologize. And I have no doubt that my sister has 

But it doesn't change the fact that she is reckless hasty to make decisions. And often doesn't care about the consequences. 

But, Please. Save my. I will do all that I can now help you. However, I 

There are these. Labels that the Oracle mentioned. Health. Make those a big small straightforward. Some of those make a big more sense. That would be greatly appreciated. Do you think that these laborers would be the thing to help save your daughter? I, Unfortunately, only see you three way. 

You could try and negotiate. 

You could. Attempt to make an offer. Replacement, They won't. 

You can see he like squeezes the arm of the chair a bit. You can actually secure it like cracking. 

You can try and challenge the centaction. Part of this life. That is sent to us will. It's these. Unaffiliated. 

You can try and find that cheap. Challenge, having to honorable combat invested. 

I hatred for the Centers on Steve. But, Be bad as it may. 

Bang. Is honorable. If you were to beat him, 

If you were to be today, In combat. That he would honor that is his loss and take his ar. 

Where could we find the chieftain then? 

I don't know exactly where it would be, but I'm shock. Asking around. You ask any of the legion as they? 

You said this, they always What would? At what not bailing. 

As I said there was a lot of animal. 

If watermelon eaters? 

I can't say that. This. 

Not a surprise. They know it's not exactly. 

My scouts is have seen his forces marshland for a while now. I would dare say that. And somebody got that contact with them. 

See, just always need to work. See, just always me. So, he wouldn't necessarily have to be 

That's why I can't strike them down my data deserve. 

Songs. 

But, As I say, He saved my daughter. I will give you what I know about these three laborers. The missing report. Birthdays. 

Help me, I will help you. This point, you know, she know that he's having a really hard time ever even looking at you. Oh yeah, it's a glance and then it's like an obedient. Look specifically, 

He seems to be sobering. 

I see no reason why we cannot Supposed to. Babe, when you like your child, that's cool thing to And I for one will not stand for me. I've never been much for sacrifice. The way you said that, I thought you were supposed What's wrong with my voice? 

I I personally think that we negotiation with them is If they already protect us on site twice. Now, I'm much, I'm such inclined to not not trust anything that they want. Anyway, They've already tried to kill the Oracle for for that is helpful. If she's been it seems to me that there are enemy Unless it's some point in the future, we think they'll be useful. 

When I was sent done, that is super Daughter. I can't. It's going to take her back. Either way. I'm telling maybe the most likely And besides that, it's only one person. 

Oh, I'm sure it's nothing to be trifled with sure, but at least it's not fighting a whole army. I say we took it. I agree with her. Well. That's good to hear. Please. My cities at Georgia disposal. Please make your preparation, Do whatever it is that you need. We are at your service. 

Is there a question before we leave? Is there anyone in the city and may know more about this chief than? More information, we know before. I would start by seeking out. Captain Titus. Most of my generals are not the northern gates. They will come. 

One last question. What are your plans? What's the oath is over? 

He stands up and for a brief moment. He almost seems to change from this kind of. It's almost like looking at four from And fierce. He stands up at a full and he's a giant of a man. You're a good six, fine. He's easily topping you at like 12:30, Goes like this, the acts and the spear immediately launch into his hands. 

God. 

It will die. 

But instead of over and he almost seems to serve again slightly more than another good analogy. As everybody seen the Lord of the Rings movie, The scene in the Hobbit where Gandalf yelled back, He seems to grow and become 

Buddy. What's up buddy? I will leave. Yeah, I will give a stiff ball Was in honor to meet you my king and then I will I can turn the AC on. 

I am sorry. That I have not been a better father, too. I'm sorry. Give a Simple. Naut of them. Keep walking. I'm more perception. Each check is everybody's leaving. 

I'm natural 20. 

Devin, I don't know how to spell that different power. Is it on? 

You lost your brother. Play YouTube. I'm trying to think of what that might be. The one from this world had something like that but yeah, it was like you can change your role. I've got nowhere. It is me, Which one of you has taken. Fly of Eric Miller. Barium barium? 

He's holding a, he's holding a dagger, but it's like a great solid day. 

Steve, I'm sure you've seen known. That's not, it's like that. 

Talking like that or escorted out. By another attendant. Out of the frog and to the entrance of the pets. 

This is crazy past couple like week and old web. We've met multiple gods. Was strange was not what I was expecting. Chiropractic with us but she weighed out of us made perception. Check. Okay. 

Oh, my never likes them. 

11, You look around and you do see her ways off? Not looking as car once again. But looking as the red hat, back entered the city with you, she seems to be kind of up on what almost is like, kind of like a wall surrounding the palace. She just seems to be saying they're looking out over the city like Stanley on the other side. 

And we were just asking for it out by just regarding a regular attention. What would go to Fargo? Going to try? An audience with Captain or Yeah, so if there's a guard around, can I ask them As the attendant is about ready to head back in, you have an opportunity to call out to them. 

Yes. I'll I'll do that there. Can you tell us where company is? Yes, of course. Do you need him for something? If you want to talk to him about next steps after talking with you. Okay. I can go and see if he's available. He should be in the war room. 

Thank you and he runs off. Okay. Yeah, probably to get anything that mean time. Nothing. Seems like this is your chance to cheer her up. 

She looks like sad. I guess you can't see her face. She, she she's basically like up on the wall sitting. Oh, just got a job. Don't they like Kind of like from what you can see, she's sitting like this, I mean, It's not every day you get. You get to give back to your God. 

You get closer to me than the walls, pretty high. I will go like I'll stay like a couple feet away. She's like on the edge. It's a race walking. For a second or two. Think about The goddess of bars, whatever, and that he will. Hold on. My conductor sticks a little bit and then we'll use the performance of creation. 

So, it's kind of like, a little I will. Time of it. I'll climb up and 

He is wrong. You have many followers. 

And I know that your words are true. And I thank you for saying them, anyway. He is right in a way then I have never found someone to eat in love with that. Much is true. I think that's because I'm not looking for. That's kind of intimacy. I care about people. 

General sense. But if an individual general sense of, that makes sense. 

We all see love in the wrong way. Who's to say, what? 

Should be the same as what. Oh, I sent my hope that no one thinks. 

He's a man. She turns over as she says that it looks at you Helios. I am sorry. But kids. Oh, I just knew I wasn't even hearing their conversation, but he is Say I assume he was probably just like Standing there. You kind of stared out over the city just like Whatever. 

Do you know how many? I did not, but it seems. It's In the double digits. Do you know how many of them? He remembers their name? I think this much lower. How many children he has? Well, it's literally at least two. Do you know how many he knows about? 

I'm going to say one more that I want. The selfish pig. Headed fool is only care about one of his children. No idea. Why? He doesn't know who they are. He doesn't seek them out. It doesn't check it on. I checking on all of them. Somebody ask. Especially if that problem. 

Nope. 

I do not think I could respect anymore. 

Just, 

I'm wanting to be reviews today. Right. Honorable no book. He would look at people and struggle. And would not sit idly by and let them pee. It would be the first one to rush to the defense of those. How can cats see past his own name? 

We will have to light the fire, perhaps with helios itself with him. Showing that. 

I feel like he was better. But I suppose that's his choice. But by the other 

Of course, very easy to talk. Well. 

I would say the same of you. Perhaps it is because we are 

The lighter things of life. Well, without them. Your appointment. And, 

How close is everybody at this point? I'm assuming the walls farther away. They don't hear it Well and he can't even play the sex music cuz he's the barber. 

Well, I guess I guess it's true. What they say here, helios? Never meet you heroes. 

That there was strange. I'm about to be like, sorry falling for from me his days of glory. It seems like it. I don't I wish I understood more about this. I was cuz I can't tell if he's just he's being caught up in it or or what? 

If you'd rather read, there's a new new one and King of the Hill. Revivals 

I would definitely watch it cuz of course they're doing, you know, in the future. So it's going to be interesting to see what the date. You know, something that takes sorry, let me know, it was always a pretty good day like 30 year old millennial, still living at home. 

But then, I don't want to work at Strickland Probably. Okay. Yeah. I'm curious to see what fucking modern down. I didn't be so great. I could see a whole episode where he, what he's says isn't nearly as crazy as what other people are saying now. I was right about JFK. 

But then there's like this. Amira episode. This is a quick ketchup. You those of you that are watching, whatever conversations you're having You watches Cara. Kind of does like a like leans back falls down like out of you not out of you. She's falling back towards the hill and then like as she goes down, quickly flips, right? 

Turns watch sees, Kadeem start to slowly climb down the ladder and she starts making her way towards the rest of you. She's just next. It wasn't like tapping her foot, waiting on. Kadeem to get back. After 3 hours, the letter will disappear. Anyway, so I'll send you a conversation right? 

Or yeah. So what do you think the the oath will change will change Pythor for the better? Or do you think that there's just some way around it that he's just not considering 

I suppose it could be a bit of both. I mean, you saw the same thing. The rest of us did. He is. Not. At the level of strength or glory that he used to be. It'll be. I would be interested to know what. The Tigers what time it did to offend himself. 

It would be hard to even speculate. Right now, when I care as much, it does make sense of peace. Maybe impacts, but Going to need his help. You're you're definitely right. I'm not so sure about getting the help for our trials yet but I don't, I'm certainly eager to entertain the prospect of saving the innocent You want reducing? 

Potential honesty drugs. Exactly. At least one more. Problem. No. I'll just be waiting for her though. What Anything else? Nope, before we go I have going to take the like put a letter sideways because if someone's on it at 3 hours somebody climbs up and then the ladder disappears. 

We got a jumper. Search for flashing, like, 

Are you all right? Of course. Maybe persuasion or deception. You don't have to tell me which of you. It's the same either way, It is a natural for a total of 22 but I would say Helios is I guess Prime emotions or whatever right now anyway for you know your DM knowledge. 

He's was so bothered by the fact of the whole encounter that just went down, He's probably more. So preparing himself for what's to come because He sees this as his burden to bear, saving his apparent half sister, 

Area set. I have always been impressed by your I suppose mental fortitude is the best way to put it, but then to be honest, more impressed with that then your feet substrate, not to diminish them. Christmas. 

Thank you. I am sorry that you had to see me. 

How do I get to say this? What better way to potentially rouse? Someone than show them their failures? One thing, my uncle always told me was to learn from my mistakes. 

So, are you? Certainly not as wise as yourself, but I will accept the compliment. I will take one as well. I said, I 

Are you all right? All we can do is try to learn from them. We don't repeat. 

And you start to hear the playing game footsteps not running, but deliberately walking, and you look up and you see captain Titus coming out with the attendant who kind of points over and then bowels and expecting. I see your audience with his majesty has come to its conclusion. The attendance mentioned that you needed my assistance and something. 

How can I help? Well, we wish to if you were aware another location, perhaps of any of the centaur camps that may contain the war chief bane, or I, You know, a man I swear Bayonetta's was last 14. 

Why exactly. Yes, It seems as though the king thinks that one of the few ways to Relieve the threat on his daughter's life is to challenge the warchief bane or in honorable combat. That's his ex his solution. Well, it is demanded. He? Says that or is honorable 

More than others I suppose. But that's the sun. It seems as though our options at this point unless you have more information than what we were given. It is try to challenge Bay nor to a door when hope that if he can be bested that he honors the arrangement and leads, otherwise it is find a replacement sacrifice or cut a deal with followers of Sidron. 

And personally, I don't find either of the ladder to very likely 

No. There shouldn't be. If you ordered. So John is not. 

But to try and challenge the chief, then Has to be suicide. It's an uneven fight because they are chasing the location. You will most likely be fighting in the midst of their army. Should any of them decide that? That feeling less than you are against of, possibly thousands of centaur. 

We can't see that. Going well. 

Did. My brother happened to say, How the order expected? He's don't should be sacrificed. Matt doesn't exactly remember the exact details but he lives. I'm sure it would go down. It was the the hell, his daughter was sacrificed, but we have to go in sacrificing. Yeah, that's so far. 

Yeah, that's the name. I didn't remember How the cold expected his daughter to be sacrificed. Yeah, Helios would relay the name Esther Brock and sacrificer to the Bassetlists. 

Well. 

If we know the location. When the sacrifices supposed to happen and we know what she's supposed to be sacrificed to, If there's things don't exist. She can't be sacrificed. I have a similar thought between the front room, but Who's to say can't just fight? Well, that might Whenever you get me, the key thing. 

To make sure that something else doesn't get sent. Seth. 

Bunt. If that were to happen, I thought would have sent his daughter to the sacrifice as agreed. She went as agree. She waited for the allotted time, as agreed. And nothing showed up. So, That could be me. Anyway, of Completing this decree. It's a little bit about. 

Makes sense to me. I don't know if I can say anything tonight. I'm not too much of a fan either, unless, unless we could somehow reverse polymorph some sort of creature into her. 

Another idea. 

Is, is Kira here? Probably would be a bit too direct of an intervention. I would think. She changed it again, Shimmer like the visage, goes away for brief moment. You see the symbols that she's pointing in and it's immediately, So, Or would it be someone in his place so that it was her? 

Who was there to be satisfied? That's what it'll tea will come in a person. He did we probably have bigger problems. How would he know that I was tired of the sacrificed? I don't know. Wood, probably have some kind of Possibly have lemon juice more. Trusted followers, do something. 

I know that. Doing a bit of. Investigated say, I do know that there is currently a contingent of the Order a cigar. Currently under the control of a man named Gaia of March itself. I don't know. I'm missing that. I'm sorry guys. Julius Caesar. I take a look at his character shoes. 

Real quick life out of sheer curiosity because I think this will be something. It's simple. We just get his fellow Sedron called this decision. If we thought that wasn't someone, Magical. You make an image. 

Thank you. Take your magic. You know, immediately. 

Piper didn't tell us how long if the Sagaros would happen that his daughter would have to wait there. I don't believe that was mentioned Cuz we don't know the specifics are else, we probably questions right now cuz it's like be here at this time on this day and then you know, college rules they didn't show in 15 minutes. 

So I left supposed to inform you that the day of the sacrifice which Is not immediately around the well, it's not like it has to be. This day is a time you have between now and this day. So you have about seven days. And the procedure for lack of a better time is in the morning, like, on the morning of a day, bring her to the location. 

Put her in, whatever spot you wrote and she is to wake them. Until the best of this comment killed. And she has to be there, basically, from Dawn, And not. And that if she is there the whole time. The the the cold that was the minute, she's there at it for any time. 

She's gonna be killing me. It's the in part of the, the man is that she stay there. The entire from dawn to my So theoretically, then at any day between now and the next week deadline, if she's there for an entire day, it's done. Assuming that, of course we killed a vessel isn't killed nothing. 

That's good. That is information. I should have given you and what car was trying to kind of got into the the trick. 

Unless, You think of course you could make a good imitation? I was just thinking, I don't know, I will be like maybe make it out of clay or something, but we have to make it like clothes. Yes. What do you have any magic that could do it? 

To theoretically, there should be no risk, right? As long as the creatures are dead. So in the cultists don't have instructions to just color if nothing comes 

We should be able to prevent that. I would think. Then that fast was I think it has to be before we continue to upload. 

Of course. 

That a curiosity, what? I recognize that name at all. Make a history check. 

Eight. You know, that Pythor has a daughter that he cared about The name isn't really running about. Yeah, I just, I mean, I guess we don't even know an age technically. So I've just curious if she was, you know, in some position of power around the city that I would have been familiar with but don't remember that. 

I would say that, you know, that by keeping you did know that, Python $100, if you did know that she Is kind of like a princess in the fact that she's known and recognized around the city that she has some influence, but she's not like running. 

I said anything else? I can be of assistance. Think that's all for now. Captain and thank you for your time and your service. 

Liberty, tell you the location of Fan art, do you still want to know the general area as to fighting probably would not be bad to know as a contingency? He pulls out a map. My bad. I completely thought that he actually told us before we started talking about something else. 

Oh boy. That's very funny babe. So this is the store kind of in this area. There is a field. Yeah. Expenses of mountains on either side, there is this large kind of open valley that according to the last scout reports where the largest Congregation of centaurs has been happening. 

And supposedly Baynor has been cited. 

He then like rolls up the map. And then answer to Would this be beneficial to whatever you hear us? Are getting ready. Perhaps, thank you. Peace. 

Do anything to? Reignite. He's interesting. And it looks around. Looks at Cara. He isn't really sure who is currently because she saw him. Thank you. Do something. 

People. I love it. But, 

Yes. 

Trying to be seeking out the lady or Nora, then. 

I know I suppose that's a good first step. No point in continuing to further plan if she refuses to be a part of it. Let's make haste. Back up to the patterns swirl away in a while soon, we haven't moved far from the sun. I will quit her keep this on lunch. 

Low notified. 

Plausible, deniability would be good. Yeah, that's way. The perfect phrase. I cannot be said any other way. Yes. I don't ever wish you. Do you know? Have to go back inside. I'm curious, I'm going to go back inside and ask him. I'll just making forget that I asked. And, Oh, let's try it. 

All right, Thor. Fair enough. 

Leads away. I'm headed back. I do like past Mara. She's still kind of giving you just a look of like, I don't, I don't know what to make of that last idea I've never interacted with God before. 

I'm new to this whole place. It seems like you would be affected by magic like anybody else, but I guess not. Nope. 

You just walk back inside? Yeah, All right. You walk back up to the main gate and you see two soldiers standing guard. To kind of test please. Can we help you? We were wondering if I would be possible to see an audience with a title. Be the princess or generally that people just call her. 

If it's possible, we seek an audience with a They will pay each other. 

I suppose we will have to go talk to his majesty about that first. Excuse me. Never mind. You do that gift of gas? I mean, I'm just mumbling at this point. I hello. Can we help you? Well yeah, that wouldn't get rid of what I said just what? Yeah. 

Or whatever. And like I said, don't worry, I have it contingency for this, if he, if Pythor asked why Couple minutes, go by the soldier comes back. As majesty would like to know the purpose. Of course. How to praise this. Delicately tell his man, just the that. It is a family matter who he will understand. 

His eyes narrow as he looks at you. And he starts to seem to think that's why it didn't just want to say that. I will. And you notice that he looks at you and then his eyes immediately flicked to the disguise car. I'll text back to you. Plus, I will go tell his majesty that it is a 

Stores. Open one more time. Regard comes out and goes. He bids you to enter my thanks. Negative side. I do not. He escorts, you back to the front. No, it's just me going in. I'm not I'm not knowing why I was wondering. Why is this a like me going back to talk to Python to explain or is this stuff you attempt to enter the other guard actually, like, puts his spear in the doorway? 

He doesn't say all we not call apart the same human family. Oh boy. Okay. Okay, that's there's no other. What do you need? Okay. Now Cigar. 

Yeah, but she's already going. It's just me walking next to the apartment. I think you may be thinking of is this down at the field in Denver. That it's a family. He'll be like pulls the door. Open again. Looks and still doesn't see me, but his very appreciate it. 

All right, I'm just going to go around the store town and those are your opportunities like trying to subtly. Imagine Whatever, as well. Once again. 

You walk in Cara seems to come from behind one. Let's see how this goes. I suppose I shouldn't say, it could go poorly than the last meeting we had in this room, but I wouldn't want to jinx it. 

Which is why I for the timer being side. Yes, of course, that was sort of my intention that you saw originally saw the attendance fee. You see it open and out steps. Very lovely. Upper 20s. Long copper hair. Very similar to pythons. The same, right, blue eyes that Piper has A fairly muscular bill clearly is in somebody that has been doing a lot of It's natural, but again, to be expected. 

And she kind of walks in. Stops and looks at you. 

I always have to feel like that. You were. One of father's children. Yes. He didn't let me go to the To the arena. But I I saw a couple of your fights. You fight like, father used to Thank you for the compliment. It is Nice to finally meet you when I suppose. 

The fact that you suspected makes this next part of a little bit easier, She walks over and kind of awkwardly, like, starts to reach out. Yeah, I will just kind of follow her about it. And then like sure. Not that I'm super great at that, but Glad to finally meet you lately, know you what is also coming from an understanding of being around your father or father, your father, she knows what he is, who he is, and how he acts and probably knows him better than most people, of course, whatever interaction you had was probably not good. 

And is feeling that awkwardness even though she she is, he does want to like, get to know each other and his generally trying, but knows that there is going to always be some uncomfortableness about this. So it doesn't have them. I mean, from him, it feels that they're good. 

At this point, I will use message to Helios and just let you know that if at all else fails a legitimate reason we need to know where she is, it will be so that we could protect her. I mean, it's there. I mean, that's we're going to find out in two seconds anyway, but just start mixed dollars. 

I was just going to put it right out in the fucking open. I mean, if she's going to be walking into this, kind of danger, she needs to know, Right. We being my friends and I the so-called Heroes of the Oracle We heavily ideas that how to escape your current predicament. 

I figured I thought I would have brought this to you. Brought us up. 

I can save the city. By my debt, I'm willing to do it. It is my duty. As one of the ruling members of this city to protect the city one, life equally is a reasonable. 

A noble thought though, if we're speaking of duty, I Believe to an extent, it is mine to protect you as well. What family does is it not It's we believe we may have come up with a solution to him, avoid your potential death. So, it would involve. How's it going phrases? 

A bit of a side step as it. So, You are to be sacrificed to the bathrooms, right? Well, if there are no basilisks to Take your sacrifice. If you appear at Esther's rock, and No one comes to the sacrifice. Has the Demand, not been fulfilled. Based on how Diastic events that you would forfeit if I were to be there. 

From Dawn until dusk. But that wouldn't be good, The field goes back but this is not something that they've done, only once before The basilisk is always up here. I see. So now, That stipulation is a bit of. If it doesn't happen, they will know that something when a writing appointment is Well. 

To be honest, I don't think that they would think of that. They've used this location as a virtual sacrifice to draw on many a times and it's always happening. 

So, are you? Play the best. That seems to be the best way out of the situation. There's a dangerous creature. Well, putting yourself to me. Danger. Frankly, it's something we've done before. It seems to be the option of We do this. Then we save your life, or We try to challenge the ward chief of the centers to see if he can get his armies to back down. 

Why does set of options? Now again, 

Because, I think it is necessary to have it set and I appreciate it with everything that you are thinking. But again, You do not have to. There's no need to put other people's lives at stake tomorrow. 

Sorry that I'm bored. Sorry, before you even started. 

So I'm just thinking about exactly how he was supposed to respond. 

And as I said before, it is my duty to do what I can. My friends and I, Well, some of us more so than others. We are fighters. And if there's a way to avoid bloodshed, we believe it is best to take it. I mean, you are innocent of all of this. 

Chicago reaches out, take your hand and took the hand on it. Truly do wish that I would like to. Strong. Able. Able to say more than just and see words. Grateful for opport. 

What do you mean you're willing to sacrifice your life? For the city. If that is not strong, I don't know what it is. Thank you for your words. 

Your help gets decreased. No, I got I say the words, but I have lost several nights worth sleep. Aaron myself for my death, which is 

Has a daughter of Piper. I'd like to say that that doesn't fight. I did not that. 

So with this this plan, what would you need a big? What could I do? Well. I suppose the main reason we wanted to come and bring this to, you wasn't of course, the risk you were taking is great shouldn't by companions and I fail in our test. Well you know what would happen? 

But you won't hang up your companions fail. And the city is still safe, I guess. It is a, it is a risk. I am willing and prepared to take My thank you for your courage. 

I think that it would be the best. 

My thoughts, exactly. 

Let me know when you're ready or focus. I will do my best to prepare him because I can 

Fortunately, it's not exactly going to do. Yes, I understand. Reaches an individual, much more natural, right? Thank you. Thank you as well. When this is over, if if you're with them I'd like to talk I would like that. He kind of gives like a bowel hurts and petty deal. 

They don't give him more formal bowel. 

Yeah, let me take you and turn to leave this idea. I left one. Much better than expected. Yes, and Charlotte's over and I know he's still standing there now. Kind of head cocked mouth slightly open. I'll worry about that. Yes. You first I want to just be me loudly talking with my boys about centaurs and our strategy to attend or like not that strategy to like to Parker deal. 

And like, what would you say in the temp to throw off anyone, listening? Okay, exposure, I would say, yes, You can help him. Send a great idea. What a great idea. What's a great idea. Okay. Conversation about strategies, what you would need? And at first Balfour, you stop by going But very quickly listening to the life, the words, the tone You you slowly pick up what can eat is doing, and you will create. 

And eventually, all of you are are conversing and it's so convincing that throughout this charade. You've actually pulled in Some of the guards, as they are going about their cash to more, Hold them in to the plan. Better ideas and have a locate the same fathers. How do I identify, who is being our specifically? 

When you see him, Do they happen to know any of the scent or customs, or gaining audience with important members, Anything to guarantee. And you like we're just starting to stretch a monkey's guard that the heroes of the oracle are planning and excursion to the symptoms. I like to say started talking to me about that. 

I was about to say bastille is when Mary said something. Okay, so yeah. It's spreading to the guards and they are all like Taking it like we will make sure that this information does not go beyond any of the guards. Anybody that learns of this will die. This is too important to allow spies to know Thank you for your description. 

It is so convincing that Captain Titus has been a part of this. You got him involved. Oh boy. Okay, he's not So that happens. You also wanted to do something. I'll wait till later. Thanks about it and kind of goes whatever The other guard that was doing. This just goes. 

Wait a minute, but who are you? And was she And the other guy is looking at him like, freaking talking 

Yeah, possible. Before I fill them in, on how it went. I want to take them kind of like off to the side somewhere there if you were fine years. Okay, you'll have to fill me in. Take them somewhere. It's the kind of thing that it's everybody knows about some people in the city, don't like them because of the implication. 

They are basically restaurants specifically designed for private usually 

Okay, I thought that was the implication. Anybody can go in there and have a like supposedly a completely silent. Nobody will hear conversation. That could be that. At the same time, a lot of the soldiers, use it a lot of merchants use it So it's like that like that is there a whole dinner, They are good restaurant but they really have taken like extra care for these kind of things While a lot of citizens are like we don't like that as a concept, They are so widely used by the soldiers by the merchant, that they're just a business and you know, of them Leave the way to one of them. 

All right? You leave the way to the closest one which actually happens to be one of the better ones like reputation-wise. Better wide reputation because this one called the silent spell is actually widely known that the proprietors arcane users in their own, right. Actually specifically put off around each of their like dining rooms spells to actually God against people. 

Over hearing people looking at people appearing. And I feel like they like spend a lot of time and ever and keeping my money spells. Like they are maintained, they are not handed like a list of ways to prove that they only do this, they don't have any other spelling. 

So that is the Most like I class one gadget. And as you start making your way towards that car, it looks surprising. It's not surprising, It's expected. 

I'm not with you most of the day, yet you never mind. I should expect no difference. Remind out of the gutter merit. Oh, this is Nick's mortgage like More impressed. Like, if America could be in two places, wait, if they're too marriage, that means there's four times, the luck, Or four times the unlock. 

Oh no, you can't do Steve like this. You've been so good to him. He'll only remember that. Now, I give you a 16 and I gift of God saying, you don't know, I helped Steve's beverage just kids and it's like, damn, I'm so good. 101. 

Single. Okay. Well, the bouncing The bouncing he says and then slanted his boss. That's what I say. It is a very nice establishment almost kind of ordinary. Like it's not decorated to be fantastic. That's not the drawing right of this place but a woman walks out wearing kind of typical arcane style rogue and she goes. 

Yeah. Yeah, probably. And I will be meta-wise. I assume an hour will probably do one hour should do it. Yes. No. I have to count to make. Where is Cairo? She's standing right there. Just gone. Like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. That would be 7 of us. 

Yeah actually just kind of like of course. Mistress. Car looks down. Right books back. And there is nothing like around the door. She looks at it and goes. 

So, before we're going for them, I will be paying double to the room. I was never here. 

And before you even walk, Page kind of list her hands and starts passing and you all slow down. You're all currently invisible. 

Black doorways tables. The other ones that just seem like, there's just blackness as you look in the rooms. You step inside You also have inside and you see on the inside of the door, there are also and they immediately light upon stepping in What. Immediately Thank you for your patience. 

Now, that you have entered the room individuals on the outside cannot see. It cannot hear him. And once I leave I have to ask for permission to bring to enter back in to bring you. Your nobody can enter without expression as you can see, and she starts pointing out all the locations that around this room are various rooms of different kinds. 

If there's anybody who is Find with you. You can, of course, have them verify that things do exactly. But they are. I'll take a look. Oh boy. Is hoping, yep. I don't have anymore. Well, I could do a lucky. 

12:00 magically darkness from an outside perspective. You got a natural funny? Correct? Yeah. For a total of 25 women You recognize Paul you see ones to keep sound from him from entering this room. You see wants to keep sound from exitings and you see the one that close it to me You see one is that repels scrime spells? 

You see ones that tamper with teleportation spells for people entering that teleportation spells from in the room still but ones generated from outside and or teleport somebody already You see a bunch of rooms like this, Do not see a room. To that does anything different that the woman described as she points up all out of her, you see all of that and they do exactly and you recognize that they do exactly what she says. 

And she kind of does this and the menus appear? I know. One quick question, if we were to leave the archway, could we come back in or is it locked out for an hour? As the pot, as the Purchases purchases of this room for the next hour, You are able to come and go as you please. 

After that, he will reset. Since that is the time that you app. 

Would you like for a moment to go or shut up? I think we'll need a moment. She locks out and and you can still see out the door, Do you watch as she walks out and then turns back to walk back. What's the direction where she was originally? A few seconds later, she comes back and goes. 

If you need me, ring the bell. And there's a small bill. You start to look. They have a wide variety. You recognize a couple of Delicacies specifically to us having the location. Do you see a lot of local cuisine from different cities? I just forgot what your name was.
