High Thor's daughter. Consider. Their plan was to try and locate these hybrid. You know that's alone. Yep. I got hydraulic brain for some reason. They're not terribly different. Oh yes, I guess that's true. They word magic. Okay put it together. Going out, one evening late at night. You did eventually discover the location of these basilisks layer making your way across the river with some difficulty, some easy you made away into this cavernous area finding a long, excuse me, tunnel structure.

That seemed to have been Relatively recently dug out. Someone's getting serenaded. Music was like, making what appeared to be a large open?

Debating on how to handle this situation. Merrick step forward to enter the room triggering and unseen trap. Casting the lightning bolt and which comment initiated you took on the four, basilisks of this cave. And the one quote, unquote hidden cultures, who seemed to be manipulated with somehow. Combat was happening.

I thought it was that comment was some. That didn't happen. I might be dying. How much did have yes? Combat did happen. Where individuals were trading blows with these basilisks. The cultists never really got off a shot as he was incinerated, they got all of a shot. No, the lightning, bully that wasn't him.

Well, treating, well, I just said it. The lightning bolt was a trap. And I assumed it was him. Nobody. Nobody investigated the opening. So nobody saw the golf I couldn't see because we were also busy. Yeah. Well, to be fair once that fired off, it really kicked off because had commented.

Yeah. Oh Proving themselves victorious over the best lists and the cultists the group investigated the scene located, what appeared to be a resting area habitat for the basilisks finding what appeared to be a makeshift. Layer for the cultists a location to store, things a couple of papers some notes, and instructions, some sleeping arrangements of a kind also, expecting the ashes of the cultist.

Two items were located on. It's remaining a pair of goggles of night vision and what appeared to be a big. Investigating the bag, a number of treasures and trinkets were recovered including a, what appeared to be a basilisk. Inspecting documents that were on the table. It was some brief instructions from who appears to be the leader of the cultists in this area, guidance.

Giving them instruction on how to keep these best lists under their control for their purposes and that perhaps he would come and inspect before the day of the sacrifice was happy also finding out you learned. That this was there was an alternative way out of this location. Some kind of trap door leading to what appeared to be makeshift stairs, leading to the upper ledges of the cliff face.

However, Having a little difficulty. Not just so blue, having a little bit of difficulty, finding this track door, the group decided to make their way back out the way that they had come. They managed to make their way down holding their breath long enough to make it out of the water risk happening at which point resurfacing.

They were able to determine that. A number of individuals were across the way, not far from where they had originally set out trying to make themselves stealthy. They Most floated somewhat beneath the surface of the water downstream. During this time, you were able to determine that the individuals across the way were cara and guys himself making the way.

Down river and eventually out of the river. Towards the west banks, you made your way up the hills to try and wait out the return of guidance to the city. When you were getting ready to thinking that enough time, had passed getting ready to make your way back in a large beacon of lights seem to suddenly appear on waiting.

You did see that it was a vegan put upon goddess much to his displeasure based on his facial expression. After a brief exchanging of words, confrontation between himself and Cara guys. Eventually made his way back into the city to where Waiting a couple of moments after he's departure, you reconvened with Cara and she determined that before discussions happen, perhaps it would be best to get back to you or more secure hotel with the words and magical barriers that she had previously.

Casting greater invisibility upon all of you. She walked back into the city after a nice refreshing evening walking away back to the hotel. The in that you would previously stayed That you had previously planned to stay, you made your way back up to the room where she dropped the invisibility spell.

The door has been closed and that's where we pick back. Playing at my dad's. Well, friends, ask which dagger I should know about. Oh, You check my something light. Well, it seems like we did something good there. I don't think they'll be bothering us anymore. Now what do we think we should do Helios?

Well, I'm assuming that are business was taken care of first up. Yes. Or yeah. I think we did mention that last time but just nearby over again. Yeah, yeah, business wasn't even taken care of. It's very good. And to answer your question mark, I assume since it sounded like from what I think it was Val door that heard the conversation they from what Balthazar told us.

Oh No it was in the letter that could be yeah. Anything was gonna go in the spa from what Kadim said was in the letter. We probably want to do this ritual as soon as possible. But if you had any suspicions that the thought of was behind this, they would be right.

What? Yeah, I think that was rather obvious was

And now we know for sure. It's good to know. I don't suppose there would be any. Proof. It's right on Kadeem. The letter. I think this map of the Colts involvement are proof that we were. Oh we we took we also took some of their preferably symbols that the cult was about yeah, manipulate him.

Independent creatures. That better. Yeah, we told we totally have that. That's right. That is this. The letter could even found, says angle, she takes letter recently reads it and probably wait 0.75 seconds. A little bit. Now the process and how to control best That's I think they were using unborn baby as the egg.

They had a basil. Big, they were using the egg to make that one egg. That's good. Now I don't know. Do you notice anything's special on those goggles? You found to do? Speaking of one section tomorrow. Yeah, you took a walk here, right? You hit a man. For now, we should probably make sure those stay hidden.

Well, in the room, what? No we need to. I was curious if there was any simple or anything playing it back to them on there. Let me take a look. First, you can investigate, I simply meant can be one. We are out and about since They might recognize they'll jump in the coldest.

May rank know. Are shit equipment, they got nothing for you got to sleep, got a good investigation. Yes, on these Yeah, I was at one, not exactly. Common item, there's nothing on this item to determine if it's owned age or previous permit. So like for all you can tell perhaps the coldest buckets barely so using a name or like any kind of name like symbol.

Yeah they're actually isn't any simple. I don't see anything on these. Goals. Good to know. Yeah but they do help me see in the dark. So if anyone else uses we have that done, what do you? I don't know if you can see the dark or not. I'm quite okay, we have that, I think it's good for you to keep them.

It's right now. Yeah. Right. Because if as long as I know that we'll be needing it needing to see in the dark. Again, I can just prepare the spell for it. What should we do with the sec? Hold onto it. We want to keep you always want to hold onto that.

As you think we took it. Yeah, one should never lose track of his sack. That's my grandfather already said. Just keep both Nick and America. I'm facing with me and unless you need metaphorically, how does one lose one sack? For five, I had a buddy. This was married. One better enough.

I suppose. But anybody watching this, I don't know capable of caring. Much weight is it? Well, that's what the backs for. It's magic. Pink. Goodbye. Don't you get more when you level up? It's certain level eventually but I think my next one is like it's gonna be maybe not counting the fact that we're like a head of schedule.

Yeah. Yeah right. It's not gonna be Yeah, this is a magic bag, right? So Potions will break in it, right? Normally it. Yeah, so the thing, the thing about the bag of holding is it's kind of ethereal space, which is why there's a special set of things. You can't do with bags of holding.

Like you can't put one bag of holding into another bag of holding, okay? So why not another one. It could have the universe sounds like incredibly impossible. It's all what if you take an infinite space and put it into an infinite space? It could be very dangerous but we don't have to worry about that because we only have one bag of holding.

It's also why you don't know, you don't want to know what happens to anything that are in the back of holding, if we're to get destroyed. If the bag were too. Yes, if the bag would be destroyed, they won't simply fall out. Like they would from an normal bag.

They'll be scattered about the ashfield plane. Yeah. Yeah. The astral plane actually. No. You should keep that. This is fun. They usually keep that back. This is Potions or finding the bag. I hope work is an infinite space. How do you feel? That's fine. You just reach in on our plan.

Find it. To me, natural painting. Has something magic, is the? So it just comes through, I think it'll be very useful. I'm happy big enough. So I mean a lot of things It just have it does have a little 500 pounds, they're about so it's not infinite space people.

Well, if you have small things that are nearly wayless, it's technically infinite Well no, there's a positive. It's finite 5. If it is 500 pounds. It is fine. I That's the opposite of infinite. Yeah, but you could have a 500 pound coin or you could have a 500 pound rock, it doesn't care.

Let's not what he's getting that. Said the eye. Yeah, I wouldn't get him like Just help me merge. Which what? Which way is more 500 pounds of rocks are 500 pounds of feathers? Well, they both way the same but they can they could have a different volume. They weigh the same.

That was the point, but they could have a different volume But can't put 5501 down. Correct. So, that was highlighted. Any up to 500 pounds like everybody, we need to keep going on with this snow. And in fact, or I would very much like to sleep If we are to try something tomorrow whether that will be possible or not, I don't know.

But Well, it should be fair helios. You should remove the Okay. Like I took the liberty of speaking with. My niece, this evening and father would be prudent to. Perhaps take care of this as quickly as possible. Before they have found upon them. That was one of my thinking.

Also, Time is. Not exactly an all. We happen to button. So we need to do many preparations tonight sleep because we need to rest and be ready to cover. No need to when you were talking to your sister. Did she did you make her aware of this plan? That was the entire point.

Yes, she knows that. Theoretically, at least she should be safe, though. As I mentioned before, I will be accompanying her to make sure. Excellent, you mentioned as well, right? Yes. Well, you are out and about taking care of business. I thought that it might be a good idea to see when Swedenora had.

Plan to discuss this with father, I was correct in assuming that she was planning a little bit later, but I informed her that it would be for the best to try and do this. As early as possible. Yeah. Now do you think with any of the evidence we gathered that we have any repercussions of the oath against our old friend there, I want to see one more time central, so this is actually very interesting and I'm very glad that you brought this back to me because This gives indication that.

My fool of a brother is indeed, as big of a fool as I propose. He assumed given, what information? I don't know that these best lists were followers of Had that been the case, then his hands would have been tied as per the of that is for. But these were I hate to use the word innocent, but they were just I'm native.

Given the contents of this note. Most likely they were captured probably not around this area. I don't believe that. Fastest among they live this closest, However, and then compel to do the cultivations. Now, recalled themselves are followers of syndrome and thus we can't take But these creatures, Have no affiliation and would not be protected up under the earth.

Now, my drunken brother decided to do, no kind of investigation to find what might be And simply what with their de? But, This at the very least will be a good indication to hit that in these two pay attent.

Anyway, so we need not be concerned after all. The cult can't take any direction, either. Under the elf, This has to be very careful from their perspective. Hence the reason they were probably using this deploy of their aligned creatures, Okay, so I feel like the lovely won't be able to take too much.

Directly. Hence the reason we want this taking care of quickly before they start preparing us something else? Yes. That's okay. Very well then besides this wasn't agreement that full of brother Great to sacrifice or see. So once the sacrifice happens, It is owned, have much of a So, Any other preparation seeing, is that the mountain has an exploded yet?

I don't think pipeline knows that. So he'll probably keep until tomorrow. Very nice. All right. Well then I think he prepared for a rather loud awakening. I would expect nothing less. That we'll get to bed. Done lots. Helios is hard, He's already out. The straight is a fucking, okay.

I was like, okay. Be honest, just hello. Whether to put him in a better, just leave them on the floor. Seems happy that's why. For. That's possible, baby. And, How to say We want to be good about their own power. I will be going to bed now though. I think it would take simple.

I have to waiting looking around. Probably it wasn't, maybe depends on what you strike. I don't remember if you're in the targets the the increase carrying capacity or not. So if you do, you do what easy? If not, I can I don't know what you're straight and I can push drag or lift 390.

Oh yeah. You okay, then I think that's why just for everybody for the evening. Hmm. Before I go back, we're gonna take a bath with a little bit, running through this all, this shit. Yeah. Cleaning by my clothes. Most likely if there's nothing using water there, I will say reasonable again.

There is laundry. Sorry, due to the nature of this facility, right? Yeah. There's abundant place to walk, both yourselves and your cookbook. Yeah, I just do that. Just not as expressively as you all turn to go about your evening business card of kind of nods and then walks out.

Better. Okay. I will also take I would be using the bath. I've had enough water for today, don't get it in the morning. I'm no, I just pressed the digital press the dedication. But yeah. Well I also just you know, Get the dirt off, you know? Yeah, all right, yeah, good make sure it's sacks, still there.

It could be Be careful. I think. So anybody want to do anything? Phone something no more. Mmm. We still feel like we need to watch think kind of thing hotel, right? Yeah, actually. Or something. Yeah, words on the windows. I mean, actually, again I know hilliers was already asleep but yeah, we'll probably good here.

Yeah, that's already the powering. Yeah, I've already done my work for sleep if we're going. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think that I mean, anyone who is in the bath, I don't know. You would definitely see, like, she has bite marks when it's white, or when it's wet and then a big E on her back for Emily.

He's right Rose. Right, Heber high remedy, He's really good. But I won't know. But that's what you see. She's not hiding anything. She's just like something he wants to take care of anything. You all do successfully complete along that. Yeah. Manage others said hey wears. Well take care of his bathing and shit in the morning since he usually in early Russia.

Become a night baby, I don't know. Make sure is all up in ready to go since we have to be at the rocket dog, like so, so a little bit before dawn to say about two hours, you could helioshi wake up at at a reasonable time for you. You start to take care of your morning business and routine other.

You're you're just finishing your attack. Yeah. Start all the way back. Yeah, no, no. Would you sound about that's something about right? Yeah, well it's squinting. Oh, you're woken up by that helios. You were already awake. Yeah, I imagine just coming out finishing, putting my armor and shit on to seeing the rest of them.

Look just yeah, I will go and see what's going on because I do want to see this. Well, we do need to be at the rock before dawn. So We should all both be there. Well, I'm going to the pocket. Yeah. I mean if they're open I suppose you already work what you wish but if you want to be a part of Of the rest of this.

Yeah. And yeah, that that is up to you. But yeah, I if we're I guess the question is we, if we're up at dawn so that we could here, this is about two hour two before we. Yeah, this is two hours before. No one. And you're, oh wait, it doesn't fall.

India. Great courtesy of me Padre. Can I go ahead and cast clairvoyance? So and I was kind of wanted some more places last time like over the middle of saying, right. Um so you cash clairvoyance and the image of the city comes to you a familiar one thing right.

The first thing you notice is that it looks like everybody is bursting out of there places of better living or establishment, right bursting out of the door looking around kind of like in very stages of alertness. Like, a lot of people have like their mornings like just you do see, you know, 30 guards everyone.

You see a regimen of guards running? No, from it would be From, and what we're gonna say, 10? Yeah, you do because you put your thing right around here, right? You would just start to, like, see guards starting to come from this direction and coming, like, towards your clairvoyance belt, or yeah.

Well, you're spell takes 10 minutes to cash, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. That's well, yeah. I was just wondering because I'm probably gonna go ahead and mate my way towards the castle. I don't know if you wanted to follow or not. I mean, I guess you can always catch up later.

Oh yeah right. That is completely up the you but before the 10 minute cast I probably heading out with whoever wanted to head out. Yeah yeah okay I thought I forgot about that too. So I think I'd like to do that first and then catch up. Yeah you you can catch up.

That's fine. I just wanted to make equivalent back a little. Yeah. You start asking right? Yeah. Yeah. So you stand up anybody. That's welcome to or anybody that wants to of course as well. But I'm heading out now. Yeah I will right. I mean I'll probably go, I'll go with.

Yeah, you know, stand out there. California look, I am not interested in going back to that castle and I I'm going to go check with the apocalypse open. Okay. And if he's not I'm just going to wait outside for him. Okay. So who all stand up except for hopefully, sure with merit we'll get him in a moment.

Yeah. You all make your way down the stairs on. You do see that like people are coming out of their rooms in various stages of, like dress, you do see a couple like opening the door, both of them completely naked, looking around, like, seeing that the building isn't collapsing, like early shut the door.

Very good. Are you doing? I'm slowly waking up to go find the commotion well, so you'll probably going with bowel, yeah, I'm gonna catch up. Okay. Okay, so you make your way down, there's a bunch of people staff and patrons of the end that are like, kind of in the main area.

And you do notice that some of them still kind of seem to be running around, trying to figure out what's happening, but there is a rather large Crowd and gathering crowd, neared, kind of the sitting area, not that far from where you position yourself. Ira last time and you go over there or as you, you know, I'm walking towards the door.

You see why pretty easily as Cara is sitting there in her actual appearance, just quietly just sitting there that's fine. Huh. Good morning. Good morning. I'd like to say that. It's I assume that's some of you or rather rudely awaken this morning. I think most of them work. Yes.

Yeah, not very slow. Well, She stands up and the the crowd kind of thoughts. There's just kind of a general like, silent hush. The day, she says, to all the patrons and walks out the door. You follow her, as you make your way down. Once again, you're you're met with a bunch of people like out in the street.

Trying to figure out what's going on. You get to about a position. Not huh? Which is where you all run into what appears to be about 10 soldiers running. Oh boy. Oh torch, okay, none of them seem to be in a aggressive stance. It's more of a yeah a more of a we just got a very strange order and we are not going to argue with the person that gave it.

This one very fair Cali. Can you do veer off when you see the apothecary store and you do see a sign that does say open Now, the guards rush up to you, the one that seems to be in a captain attire but yeah, stops takes his helmet off. It is the familiar kept entitled.

That you met previously, he scans, you all looks at Cara. You see him like go for like about and stop? And then straighten. Millennium. If you would, please accompany me your It's fine. Captain you need not worry. We were on our way to see my brother. Very good. Thank you and he once again, you see him like go for about and then seem to frighten.

Clearly in a state of I'm not sure what to do. Yeah, she just kind of puts a hand on the shoulder. I take no offense from somebody. Not bad. I prefer Thank you. Put this all everybody else. There's a kidney. That's it. And you begin to be a sported towards the palace.

Of start with you Kelik. You got the front door? The sign does say open. I'll open it. You open it? Yeah. Do you walk in? Yeah. All right. You walk in was it gonna be the trick or attract? The door closes. Make a perception. Okay, well yeah, it's just like, luckily now I was like 11.

Oh, you Yeah. Now you hear it. He's not being particularly quiet. Um you hear coming from a back room? What sounds like a combination of muffled crying. A muffled screen and then girdles.

Who's got the girls somebody shitting and pissing him comments? Well when I say gurgling more, like age choking gurgling. Yeah. Anything Kelly. I woke up with this and wait there for a little bit. Okay, You wait about three minutes About three minutes go by and then you hear a familiar voice.

That kind of interesting. I didn't think that it would react like that. Hmm. Well. Sorry for your poor luck. Oh, and here very audible like By two lists, one steps. Time out from the back area and let's see if you see the nose experiment. Number up here, we're in the kind of more casual clothes than the last time.

Last time you seemed to be wearing Experiments to protect himself. This seems to be kind of like an easy like regular shirt and trousers, but he stops and goes, we're closed. The sign says we're closed. Know it didn't. Oh, Well. If I might ask, how long have you been standing there friend?

Four minutes. What can I do for you today? And he rushes forward. Oh, my metal friend. Did you return with notes? I didn't work. Did it? It didn't work in large enough quantity and I didn't bring notes. Oh no, yes yes, your payment any runs to that you hear sent you hear it combination of Anything shit.

That's And I see the numbers here. I have another pieces. Did you take those? Yes. Can I have them? No more? The deal? I See him furiously start to read them and then like you can see that like he started to read then kind of like blinks a little bit and then like leans in as he's kind of taking it back and how detailed these notes are and without fully reading the several pages, he kind of like flips through them real quick like One point.

Excellent. Excellent notes he runs back. You hear some some like And he comes back, he knows, okay. So I know we had an exactly agreed upon this, but I'm hoping that this is going to be Perhaps a continuing relationship partnership perhaps if that will work better and he puts down a bag on the decks and You see in it all.

Wow, these very generous, it hits the table, and it's a pretty auto glass. So I know that we haven't agreed upon this. I know that we the notes were part of the payment purchasing some of the things beforehand. I don't really care about that. The thing that I care about is I willing individual to continue to utilize this new inventions that I wish people to.

Yeah, you know, detailed descriptions of their effects upon different things. So I really, if you are, of course, it's completely up to you. It's your choice. I'm willing to start shame it. How about literally? This is all that I feel comfortable right now. For the time being, I'm willing to offer 300 300 gold signals and then for each invention, potion invention that I produced that you are willing and able to actually go out and reproduce such exquisite and holds up the notes a little bit and shakes them results.

A second time, I am willing to pay you an additional 100 gold for each successful test and detailed explanation of what transpired. Just like one. Oh, those are very good problem, might be. And I don't know how long my party intends to stay in this town. Oh, no problem, no problem at all.

As long as we agree on, of course, that the payment for each successful testing will only be delivered upon return of the detailed explanations. So you're able to take as many of the inventions that I have on hand at the time and take as long as you want to to find out what they do.

But of course it's if you understand that you will not see payment until you do return with the explanations and detailed results. Just there's no time living on any Sounds good. I don't want to be tested a lot. Oh, thank you. One time. I wrote 13, I heard 17.

So you actually very surprisingly. This little gnome actually gets you in a bit of a, of a knuckle crusher. It doesn't mean he's hobby is perfect, and So much job, but you are surprised that the the firmness of his bread. He's a terrorist and well, he's got I don't have anything particularly right that I can send you away with, but if you come back in a day or so, I might have another interesting thing that I put in front of touches on.

Previously the king, once it won the same thing that the last one did it. It'll be much more interesting. I've just read the parallel to it. Just says, how is it worse than? Yeah. So Here's the solution. I'll give you that here. Don't know. Would there be anything else?

I would you care to spend any of your new wages on trinkets and oddities and things that I Are that I currently? Or would you like to commission anything special? I know how to make that one.

What kind of a old take a look. Like the trinkets are other than he says trinkets, but he's got pretty much nothing but just files of different colors.

I'll ask him if there's a buffing ocean that he recommends. Kind of like a, like, a potion of healing or like a something like increases, but like a beneficial to the drinker. Ah, yes. Unfortunately, most of those I do have a number of potions but well, I should say, I used to have a number of potions.

Some that would increase an individual's vitality some that increase their physical hour. You see him trying to flesh and it's kind of unimpressive on and on of his eyes and build. And as you look at him, he's a pretty thin looking at. Unfortunately, the most of those that were reasonably amazing scripted by the military, that's better.

But if there's anything in particular, you'd like me to make, I can actually go ahead and make that and then you can return in such as that I will, of course, since it would be a specialty order, I would keep it on hand and not have it on display.

I can't think of any emotional skills. That's how they? Okay, that's a okay. If you do happen to think of anything, I'll be here when I see them. Absolutely. The more, the barrier, It's all good in a good day, and Go out towards I guess I'll make my way towards the side official rocks.

Okay, good. You start a good day to you and don't worry. Nobody's going to miss her. Hmm. Oh boy. Now I really want to meet this note. Yeah, I think it's so very good. Just right back in there. Just give him walking back into the background. I'm going to pause for a second but then there's no, there's nothing to clean up.

There's evidence, he's burned. So you make it way out. That whole thing will say the inspecting, the waiting, the communication will say that takes about roughly not I would say half. Now I'd say at that point it's not about 10 minutes or so. So at this point, I'm thinking of way to order a lot.

Yeah, we'll come to Val Thor, you complete your clairvoyance spell, you see the the town you see that there are still a lot of people kind of out and about, right? You do watches telling walks out of the apothecary for seems to get about halfway out, pause for a brief second.

Kind of shake his head and then continue out here. So where is you know the party at that they're outside of your field of vision at this point. Okay so they've made it up there in a month. Well you're right I'm not leave there. Yeah yeah I was like you.

Yeah. Because 10 10 minutes is 10 minutes and that's like yeah you probably be seeing them near this location. Getting ready to turn around like turn the corner going towards the palace because they're not at a, they're not a dead long but they're definitely like, please don't please please don't repeat Well, I assume we were probably making a decent payout anyway because we want to get this shit done.

So. And, And kind of thinking along the same lines as how to hear, we've said it to be dawned, right? Like, was that the plan? I can't. We have to be at the rocket dawn so at this point it's still like two hours before. Oh well, an hour. 10 minutes.

Minus two hours. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, you know, from the agreement that Pythor told you about that, the sacrifice has to be at the rock from gone until dust and that the the sacrifice will happen at that point of time. And if it doesn't then it's still considered it. It's like nullable.

Yeah. Okay. And attempt was made, for whatever reason, it didn't happen. So we held up our end of the bar, right? Yeah, okay. And at that point, I'm not gonna catch them anyway. So

I think with that, I think I'm probably going to realize you that they're most of the way. And probably things. We should go just go ahead and go to the rock in case they try and do a trap or something. Let's see here.

He America's not a morning person. Yeah, I'm not there, not a morning person but I honestly don't know what I've been doing character here. Oh you would do. It's what would marry. Oh yeah. What I guess we should just I guess we should just get to the rock I guess.

I mean if if that's what the plan is I say no reason to to change it. Yeah. And I mean did you catch whether it had to be Heliosis sister or not, or did it have to or could it be any sacrifice? Yeah, I mean, you would know from what we had talked about that.

Yeah, the the deal was now theoretically, we could have tried to bargain with the call. We could theoretically tried, but we figured that that option was not a not gonna be very feasible. Yeah. Since I just wanted to screw with five more. Yeah, I mean I say we just get out there.

Yeah. Okay. Probably just go ahead and start making our way there, then. All right. Until you start making a way towards the Secretary. All right here. Yeah, I made the mistake that I was like, somebody else was with you. Somebody else was with you, when you left, it was caliphate.

Yeah. Anyway, so come back to helios iron, you're being ushered along the guards. All look very fidgety as they walk and you gather that pretty quickly, the reason why is the fact that Their escorting. A goddess potentially against her will towards her brother who Is that our boss is angry.

Yeah, that's basically not happy. Um, so we're gonna pipe those pounds. Keep me. He was young people, what a peepee. Yeah, so you've actually made your way back to the front gates of the palace Usher and what you get beyond the main gates, most of the guards. Peel off captain Titus does continue to usually forward which one is sorry which one is the Palestine.

It's tap numerous built into the show. We have to walk like by this building. Yes right just look at that and we walk by just in case I see like sure something interestingly enough you do see us he is standing up at the top of the building like on the roof looking back.

Like watching the procession, like come towards him turn and he's not even trying to hide the fact, he's just very noticeably there. Just like working good. I don't want to like wave it we've ever spent more like, was that I meant to say, like I don't want to be like, okay, I don't want to be like, is that guy?

I don't remember yes. What I do. Yes, you would have seen him as well. Sure, no good three actually so I think I'm not but Let me actually like, hey guys, that guy is But I just need just to see if he's got it. Like you meant to whisper guys on your birthday and they're just showering.

Guy to be here. So Kadim Azure trying to like be cautious and look over you. When you do that, you actually walk eyes with. Oh okay. So like right, There's another one and I choose a mermaid. Oh basically. Squares. I was like a glare. So, students the squamous. Because that's still be something good.

You keep walking on here is a no mean right, honestly, it's kind of funny this way. Knows, exactly. He knocked his wrinkle away. Do eventually come to the past? Wait anybody else want to do anything before you get there? I'm good actually check before I just say things. Yeah, I'm good.

You are escorted to the main gate through the main gate, most of the guards peel off. Once you get in like the actual compound and tightest lead you into the actual building down the path that you've taken the last time to get to the throne room. As you're walking towards the throne in your room, you hear a very audible He says.

And like stone cracking on each, what you assume is a foot stop. He might just turns it looks at Cara kind of like I don't know what to do now she just goes piano. Before we go in there, I think it's prudent. If I go in first, wait about 10 seconds and then fall,

As English she opens the door one. Okay. Six. Seven, eight, nine. 10. What following is? Yeah, you walk in and you also see very noticeably a couple of things. One, the statues that were up the last time from the four deities, the one of kara is literally in like, very practically.

It's practically. Yeah, that's right. You also see one, the throne that Pythor said, in the last time, is noticeably cracked from like the hands like that. The army that's not armed for us from. I was noticeably cracked. Also, also, there are noticeable foot indents in the stone right in front of the chair.

You also notice a Nora looking very like stunned. By something of late standing relatively close to the channel, super close. You also see very, very visibly, cara on the ground, large gash across. Her upper torso, pythor standing above her large acts, like dripping blood, and he's just like red face, like, looking down at her, like breathing heavily.

I will immediately run up to Colorado. What have you done? And I will try to cast. So no, because at least please don't just I'm not gonna attack the guy. Well no but you know what? It couldn't work out for you. He might respect you more. Doing what's up?

Tries to punch the God of battles, just like she heals the side. Yeah could be if she needed you run over and you start to cast healing word. Still going to act as our pythor. Still heavily breathing, you do here cargo. Thank you. Just, Campus, not unexpected python not exactly the best use of your time though.

I could reach down and turn your Out. He you deserve it. What you've done? Twisting snake always going behind my back, making these plans. Not with my daughter. You're not. I won't allow it. I won't allow it.

Well, so while Kadim had run up, I would plan on I would probably actually have made my way. Kind of. That means it's pipers occupied. Anyway, around doing how she's doing. I, she makes you get about halfway towards her and she meets. You can see she is looking fine.

Probably a bit paler than the last time. Yeah, that's kind of what I've got looking is though she's just seen a very large shock. As well. Fuck, I'll just everything in character. I assume you're shocked. This dude of me. Yes. Here's we have to stop him. We have to stop him from doing what he's doing.

He's he's gonna regret it. If he hurts her.

But actually, yeah, thinking about that any character I guess I suppose that makes sense. Do you think he will? I don't know. I've never seen him like this before. Fair. You know, a much better than I do father and she's mmm. Like there is a I'm like, an I'm glad to see you and I'm glad to see you're all right, but she also does brush past you.

Yeah, that's fine. I'm running up with codeine. Yeah, he seems pretty fun threatening and like

Just trying to help Iran, you watch as an order does run up, helios behind her up to high door, and she gets in between Pythor. And technically, you can because you're in front of Cara, she gets in front of both of you father, please At Cara had nothing to do with it.

It was my idea. Only making it worse.

Don't hide any girl. I know her and her seeking ways, She put him up to this. I know it. Father. Come down. This isn't helping. You wouldn't do anything against the call. So, I took measures my measures were to sacrifice myself and save the city. To do something for our city and our people.

That was my choice. But my brother who you didn't tell me about wouldn't let me do that. He was determined to save me no more. Even if you want. Oh okay. Alias was like I'm just like I'm in danger. Here yesterday. Everyone. You do see Helios that hearing this.

Like, even without like registering, all the words, your name came on and simply turned looking at us.

I'm just looking to stand and all right, I kind of want to see what he says because I mean helios doesn't no pythrow like in order. It does he doesn't think he that python was really gonna do anything to Kyra.

In terms back and you can see aliases alive. I think this is completely just starting to like process what she just said. No, it's It's not that I wouldn't have done anything. I couldn't I can't do anything. The creatures that Creatures part of this were followers of syndrome, they were his beasts, I can't do anything against his minions against his people.

I, I wouldn't have left. I couldn't do anything. It's not that, I don't care, of course I do. But Because of what she did. I can't do anything. Interesting is everyone else? No. There's a pause. Yeah. Another completely forward and our stands up. She's like starting to heal naturally by the looks of it.

Before you get your hackles up again. Perhaps you should read. I'm gonna haggle and she hands out a very familiar looking.

Condemned that the end of that, it starts clarity could be. I'm not saying more of your lives, sister. Never lies. They are I don't need to read them. To know that they are but hollow words. If there are lies on that paper, they were not written by a chiro.

You don't know her. Like I do boy, though, I don't, but I also know where my companions and I found that letter. And where would that be? In the end of the basilisks, which we slew.

I can vouch for him, We did. There is a look of, like cutting kind of through this. Almost battlefield as you've seen before, not from him specifically. But in other warriors there's almost like Are taken abackness. Like, observing flies.

And you saw these cultists have this snatches. The letter. This she didn't just zip in like you always do and leave it there for them to find. Getting people, you would know because you actually found the letter. That's I don't think that's how goodly something here. Leos would know that on the body on the guest.

Yeah. I will. Going to say we found this that there are On in this, within the In the test justifying it now, conveniently fine. Bicycles. Make persuasion check.

Okay, seven, so that's two two. He looks at you and like he gives me real close to you and he this is like a 10 foot tall, man, he's like leaning all the way down. Practically.

Oh boy. I feel like this journey. By the way, do you have a symbol that you follow Kara, as you know, the goddess and music. You have anything, Would you outside of your insurance? I don't know, probably how we're gonna have something on that belt or something. He leans down and reaches past you and fix your your instrument staff and like the chime sound.

That's what she's Getting more tools to foul. Do what she wants listened. I won't. Be deceived sister. This has the making of all your fingerprints on it. Even if it does, what does it matter? The creatures that perform the sacrifice are dead.

Do we have anything in the backs to be taken? I do. I have things? Yeah. You I'm I'm gonna like pull out the skin. Yeah. I have scales and teeth so big. These are these proof enough. Which is out Basically like Tom's most of that. How How are you not stopped?

These creatures of sit on, we shouldn't be able to, you shouldn't be able to how and he's pointing a karma.

I think they were mere points in decisions. From. Yeah, there's creatures because trained like dogs trained like dogs helped captive by An egg, then? In other words, their brother Many fields into pretending to be citrons. When in fact just while Completely. Out from under the protection videos. Make a group persuasion and Is this everybody's talking about?

Okay, it's not bad. 18 from one of you gets to roll with advantage because car was also a part of us. Not the best bonus. So yeah because she loves him. He 13. Very close. But you did manage to succeed, even through blind rage.

And you see brother and cars. Now, fully standing again. It's it might be previewed to pay attention. Instead of wildlife. After all, how many innocents. We're sacrifice to these completely random creatures. When all you had to do was sneak and bring that cave crumbling down, I will. Just like, I don't know like that.

It's like glass and say. Like talking to well, talking to clara, we're looking at Pipeline. Okay, I'll say perhaps now is also the time for empathy But harder for this man about he was going to lose it out there. And,

Sometimes we can be.

Keep glancing, a car as I say someone was always she does look over at you And she you see, is she, she has a very hard expression at first when she like, turning from her brother to you or facing, Very hard set. And she looks at you for a couple of moments and he watches it very slowly softens.

You know, you always say that I had a way of Tricking more towards listening to, my But have you ever listened? It's all over the place. And all you have to do is And even we can learn quite a bit from the wisdom that they Correct. Oh, you and I are often having each other.

But, Yes, I had a hand. To try and save your daughter from a very noble and she looks at an oral, okay? You know, and ultimately very meaningless. It was very noble your desire to say the city, sweet child, but

Ultimately would not have gotten very And so, no, I could not simply sit. So yes. To your point. He's, they're freaking out to your point. No, it doesn't physically move if you Think about that. To save you and now they have succeeded. The Basilisks were not under the protection of They have been slain.

Information, that we need to capitalize on. Yes, we are asking an order to go to the walk and we are asking for her to stand for a day. Where nothing will happen. The best lists are going. They cannot come up to fulfill the sacri.

How do you know nothing happened? How do you know that? That person guidance will do something. Comes. He is following up. That super long is still. Just as you are. So it's only so much that guys can do unless he chooses to do it of his own volition, Man is devoted as him with absolutely no imagination.

Will most likely not. Even if he does, do you think that we are going to send your daughter out alone?

Python looks over AU Helios. My plan will be with her. I can't speak. My plan was to be with her all day. I will not leave her side. No harm will come to her as long as I draw breath. It would be there as well. It turns around to anywhere.

Father, I must I want to do this. To do everything I can to protect our city. And more importantly, the people who Simple people that live here. That is what a city is, not the buildings, not the structure, not this place, but the people that live here, I believe.

In my brother, I shot

I believe in my brother and he's contaminants, I believe everything I do. I believe in what they've done. Even if you don't.

Nephew. What do you decorah? Boy was annoyed speaking. Yeah, this is oh, yeah, yeah. What are you to heard, then? A normal would be my nephews. No, no, no. I would be my ad. Okay, yeah. So Yes.

That's why people actually do. See is pythor, just kind of drops exacts. A lot of the fire seems to be draining out of him.

Very well. Go with my personal. Thank you, battens down, and gives her a hug. You don't have.

Reaches down kind of lifts up car, huh?

I would throw away. Oh no. There it is. I'll roll fuck these things but yeah at this point helios Ira and Caden make a perception check Portland Section. You know. 30 20. In the Medicaid, he hurt her In the Medicine. Her By soon. I am pretty sure why, like, sure he's helping me eating one like the As a young woman with each other.

Yeah. But they can't hurt each other. Well, The whole thing. I thought, just against syndrome. Well yeah. It's just against it. It's so pleasant inside of what the good thing, the good. Yeah, yeah, tightness so said, you're on the Titan. Yeah, yeah, whatever. The enemy. Key meaning or something.

These yeah, yeah that one. Yeah, I don't know. It's like yeah. You know, hilarious or something? Yeah. Like if there's like a salad, is that

After that, python puts her, what's called back down. And he just Turns away. It's not just walking back towards that back of the throne room.

Now that that's taken care of, I think we should be about it. She holds out her hand to an oil if you'll come with me deep. Nor takes her hand and Carlos starts to walk out. If I will take point, all right. Did Pythor. Give me back the scales and stuff.

He dropped. Cool. I'm a paperwork. He's like, yeah, that happened a little while, that's why he's already had time to pick me. Cool. And then I'll follow. Yes out. I'm just wondering. Couple seconds. Okay. Are you like okay? Yeah, I'm just like whatever enough you do. Watch that python makes it over to his chair and like crabs, hold of it on either side and you watch as it's slowly starts to be compressed.

What's gonna leave? As I see that happening like you. All right. You eventually make your way outside of the palace back kind of into the courtyard area. Um so I assume we have to go immediately to the location. Correct? Brother, we don't have long before dawn. It felt something.

Yeah. Okay. I don't actually know where it is. Part of the network. Let me go. We will leave you there safely too and safely from You watches an aura, kind of. Let's go cars hand and runs over and gives you a hug. Okay, yeah, of course. Enough, thank you, brother.

Right? You start making your way By this point in time, Eric. And Balfour made it out of city talent. You actually see that Merrick and about Thor at are at the exit, the city gate level? Yeah, three. Since you were walking that way as well, Just yeah honor I yeah I as soon as we leave and we start making our way to the rock, I'm just gonna be looking very attentively for any cult of citron.

People make a prescription check there already. I'll say balfour, you see that talent is making his way towards you I'm not even, that's not the one. That's not quite, it's a four, all righty. So you do see a surprising thing? Well, maybe not surprisingly. You do see what looked to be about five.

Very obviously, cultists standing

Like on the rocks. Yes. On the rocks on outside, not making like they're just standing there looking as though they're just keeping an eye. They're not making any kind of movement towards it. They're not even speaking. They're just silently like practically like dark men. Just standing keeping the watch.

You do also see Like right beside them. I shouldn't walk back like the the cultists are like right around here. And you see a line of city guards doing the very same thing in position like practically standing guard. All right, try tell who was here first. Make in. How do you want to try and tell?

Who got here first by who is standing closer I suppose? Because I guess if it. Yeah, I got yeah, because I guess it goes to reason that, like, whoever has the better positioning got there first, okay, make an investigation check of the general area and the way that each group looks based on their statements way better, I'm using real dice.

Okay, 20 unnatural you can tell what the fuck yeah that these people Judging by the shifts of rock from like where people walked and stood, you gather that they actually got here at the same time, okay? And there's just kind of inspecting the general area. You actually do. Also notice that there are the telltale signs of Two individuals having already made their way towards the rock and back from.

Mm-hmm, looking at the briefest bit of telltale residue and indentation from like the piles of rock. You can tell that one of them was a lighter individual where the second person was either of much girthier status or was more heavily on And in case of note, all of the city guard or in full arm, the cultists do not appear to be All right.

Cutting ideas about or why do you think they'd be here? Which Both makes sense. Does it? I don't know why the cult would be here. You sorted over the ritual. Yeah. Or no, not there. Then it makes sense. Here you can probably probably don't have a white carrier 100.

So, Make the players just triggering that the player does it here. I have no opinion on this anyway. So, can I ask a question? So, as soon with him asked me this, I also see them there. Yes, I yeah. They're, they're married was the one that was trying to determine who got their first but I will see them.

Okay. They're very presumably, they're not trying to hide. It's so question. Yes, so they're here right on these rocks that we were already at. Yeah, I'm pretty much like the way they got down there. Go ahead. Well, just to kind of set the stages. Yes, I can from, where the two of you?

Well, the where the three of you are currently? I'm assuming you're like here, like yeah, like walk down the road we already went down. Yeah, sure. I'm thinking. Okay, okay, so yeah, looking across there, all in a line. Okay, it's a line of four towns guards. What looked to be about, maybe I don't know 10 15, maybe 20 feet gap and then four cultists in a line.

So they're clearly in a formation of line. And they're just like, but there's like a very deliberate air of. I one group is not paying, it is not acknowledging. The other, the other group is also not acknowledging the other. It's not that they're not paying attention, but they're like imagine two people that hate each other in a room, but they both have to be in the room and neither of them can make like a scene, right?

It's kind of like that. Yeah, it's very much, an atmosphere of that. And best, you can tell to answer your question. They came down the path. Like, okay, with me, right? Yeah. And just, yeah, walked up like we did yesterday? Yeah, it makes sense for us to stand between them.

Not you're also hmm. Well, you see I went. I'm fairly curious. Yeah, what what the cultists would have to say? If we told them that we suspected that there wouldn't be any peace today. Biology, tell them that. I think it's better to just make dinner. They start so because because Mexico said something like that.

How quiet are you being very quiet? Okay, role for yourself for this conversation, you're not super far away and I try and help him with this awesome. How would you try and like, describe how we're trying to help by where we were talking about this before and trying to figure out, you know, where they were here inside, trying to be.

Like, if we need to be something like the whole conversation, it's been. It's kind of how I feel that advantage for yourself. I don't know if you need it but 22, it definitely helped the first one pretty good. Anyway, I'll take it. Yeah, it was 19 verses 20 through.

So what's yourself 22? All right. These rules four percent each day. Yeah. Oh just technically eight. Although, I don't think the city guards are gonna say, Okay. So, what was it? 22? Yeah. Okay, so I will say, the three of you were paying attention. You notice that when merrick says that, None of the call test react.

One of the guards, another town guards ever. So slightly. And I would say because he is also strength, trying to be. So he did a really good job on that. I really good role. Well you're lucky, then you better hope that they're telecom snitches, you little son of a bitch drowning the highest passive perceptions.

So go for perception decisions. Help scrap on America American dollars in oh it was like, what was that? Yeah, I just didn't understand this. I get it now but Okay, so there. Stop stop. Hey, we need to look Park. We need to look part of this. Like we don't know, like you're really just such a great day to see a sacrifice.

Oh boy. Very, Let's listen. Here, I'm moving.

This. Perhaps, it's not much of my place, but if you are going to Who would? Special. Situation. Perhaps. Another play. More.

Let me think about this. I'm just gonna jump in and I want to say, We will watch from up on the hill away. Much appreciated.

The layers it merit and walks back, walks back. Oh yeah, it's going watch back without gets into position. And you do see that only one of the cultists like turn to look at the city guard as he gets back into his position. Make first make perception. Wait, investigation is for reading like investigating, what's for?

Like trying to read, somebody's like a motion, so, it's inside. Thank you. Make an inside, check the three, the three of you because you would see the this happened that's Yep. Thanks you both see. Board. Curiosity like oh I wonder why he got out of position. That's not normal for this procedure.

Hmm. Don't know what he could possibly do about it and you know kind of a lot like smug bored. Like I've seen this a hundred times I know exactly how this is gonna play out and nothing. These city folk can do can stop us. Huh. He's breaking protocol. Yeah, whatever.

It's kind of that expression. I can't really describe. Yeah, right. But this cultist is very, very indifferent to what just did belong? Oh, that's a, that's weird. Yeah, it's out of custom, right? But it doesn't seem to alarm him in any way. There's a very immense amount of like almost smug superiority, right?

Radiating from him in that look and he immediately goes back to his. Yeah. Over car around. Got the hell? Come now. Before I go I'm gonna take a good look around to see if it looks like the cultists have done anything different, or how good of a look we talk about I mean, as much as I can clean within like, You know, what are you doing?

20 30 seconds. Like just so we're right here. And there you said, right of round 11? Yeah, no. Well, kind of that. They're not the water a long here, okay? Like in formation like four cultists gap, four soldiers. Okay. So I guess I just want to check the rock itself to see if it looks like what preparations have been done and see if the if like anything weird is going on with it.

Okay you walking out there no try to clean from where I am. Okay perception check Make a percept. And are you trying to not be noticed by the eight watchers? Not particularly give me perception check. Oh, I need a lucky for that. That, that book.

Oh and perception you said yes 13 13 nothing that you can see nothing like very vividly has been done for. Perhaps the thing that you do notice is that the like fluctuable bedroom? The pole that was a fixed to the rock. Yeah, it looks as though more For like a better charm, fresher chains, and bindings have been like attached to it.

I don't want to say attached but like hung on it. I see, but as far as I can tell, there's like nothing nothing necessarily out of the ordinary about it. No, the everything looks exactly the same, okay? And you do know from the last time you've seen it, that there there are always chains like on face to it but because they've been out in the elements probably, since the last sacrifice that they are damaged rusty.

Those have been replaced by newer ones, they should be bronze dreams already. Right? That's so, wouldn't I mean they still get damaged by the elements but they at least would be independent and I mean, they would patina. Yeah. It has good point. Thank you for that. Yeah, the problems, it's the warrant battered chains that you passed last night.

Yeah. Refresh. And polished and new, yeah, I've been replaced with what looked to be. The ranch, spanking new made let last night perhaps. You're not really sure, but they're very new. Okay. Yeah, they don't. Oh, look up. All right. Okay, so can I as well? So we have to go around and up right from our before you have to unless you want to climb up the cliff now.

Yeah, you have to go back up the hill and like the south and around. So as we're doing that, you know, I'd like to say to merit, you know, we need this to look as normal as they expect it. So, We can't afford to do. Anything that we call them to think, it's not, It's just I'm just curious.

That's what they know. I feel like they would have to have had inner communication since this is their whole deal. I'm surprised that they're all seemingly unsuspicious about it. True. What reason was that? It's possible. We can't do anything at this time. I mean, fair enough I just it's just also that's it didn't seem like guys was there.

I'm sure he will be. I suppose we'll see. So we need to be ready for that but Current. Well, I mean, generally speaking wherever he goes, bad news follows Yeah, I figured by this point we're probably coming out on the cliff or something like that. Sorry there. Yeah. Yeah.

I I'd say with that because it's not a super short track. Yeah it's not sure but you do you do get to that. Yeah. So first day jump like when we were before, you know probably mimicking how they're standing. Yeah. On top of a cliff in Plainview, all right?

So, Cutting back to Helios and Ira and can be. Helios. You escorting your sister Anora and the rest out. Once you leave kind of the compound and you can move them up again. Once you get to about here, you do see something, you do see something. You see what need to be a large gatherer.

You like of the better term, and you've heard of these. But never seen it because you've never been to them. It's it's like a sacrificial procession. Representatives of the town and representatives of the call escorting, the intended, sacrifice to the location and you see a lot of the town's people are It's a very dull mood, they're trying.

They feel a lot of sadness from this and a lot. A lot of the men particular on a lot of the soldiers. You see, you Really easily pick up, you specifically videos, a combination of resentment shame. And it's anger, barely contained anger. And a lot of the townsfolk are trying to like keep it not a gloomy atmosphere but they all know what's about to happen.

So there's not a lot of celebration we'll say, but you do actually, all of you would hear a lot of would sound like jeers. Coming from a rather large procession of poultice. There are at this intersection. You do see that there are about 20 guards. All of whom look like there are about an ink like a brief moment from pulling their weapons and there are about 10 coldests.

Make that 11. Because as you count out from underneath the little awning because you hear a very audible As you watch that Gaius literally just walked off the roof and landed right beside you and he immediately walks up Bypassing you well, he's walking towards you but you're at the front.

He is right about to pass you. Do you do anything? Oh. I mean, I assume he's walking with the purpose but not like open. Hostilities walking with purpose, not with open hostility. The I am I don't think I'm gonna do anything with just one time since I would assume it this point still part of a procession.

He does deliciously. Yeah, I figured as much because I'm not going to move out of his way. Make it contested strength, check.

Of course this is the one I roll. Bad, 13 13. When you're looking at this square, is because I also did not grow, right? It's just Today I'm call this ghost for a dick move falls right on his ass. Yeah I like how the I don't even shoulder checking bag He just bounces off, actually even better.

He also rolled Well, he's stands into land, You've kind of used with people like Course, Well, unmoving. This his force made. Sure on moving this, and there is a brief flight pause. Kind of looks at you, and he does look down. Yeah, I remember, he is about a half a foot taller than about a half foot tall.

We don't meet his gaze. Meter beep. Which, And watch pass Italia, some persons and laughing with. This isn't uses me right away, and he walks up to anora who you do see like as he gets closer, like, she's doing her best even knowing all that she does. The look of this person, doesn't timid?

Yeah, of course, as he does walk past, I will turn to make sure that nothing before happens as he gets like writing in front of her. You do see like he's not blocking her from your view but you do watch as an era. Looks at you kind of makes eye contact and you see her And seem to stand a little bit straighter.

So,

Daddy final gave you up like the bad. Filthy. That's why. Well. That's not. He sacrifice, wait.

Shop.

And he starts to turn and walk away, but you do notice that he stops and immediately turns and looks at Cara who is standing right next to him or Mmm. That's another person that you let people write. Anytime support. And then like, as you make it to, basically this center of the street, each like procession forms, like on the sides, like the cultists, get into a formation, on your left side, the soldiers, get into a formation on your right, and they all start leading you out towards the town.

Before we like, well, as you're like, walking away, can I call Ira to side? Okay, still wait. Try to sailing But you sneaky, I can be.

Not me. I'm just you because you can say no. This would be the opportunity to see what's going on. There's part of you in there though. Just not just throw. Does the building have windows? The building does have windows. There are from the side that you can see that stretches towards the town that does appear to be the back of the building and their do appear to be three windows.

Okay, we see whatever do the windows uses are people. In the eyes. At this point. It's a little too far away. The light isn't great. Oh, that's right. It's also it's pretty long. That's right. Yeah, okay. Oh shit. Couldn't. I will I'm gonna just nonchalantly grab Kadeems like hand and be like, we're gonna break off.

I'm just like Then go over to the windows just like nonchalantly kind of like as walking. Like I want to walk by the windows. Kind. Well, okay, so for the record your currently moving the this direction, okay? So do you want to grab cadim and try and pull out and go back?

Maybe like angle. Okay. So it's nonchalant like okay. Yeah, step off the side. Like let everyone pass like, yeah, but I'm just like where to try and be stealthy and on scene or maybe performance check to make it. Like you'll be seen but you're making it look like you're doing something other than what you're in.

You could integrate, as we're going, I'll say something like, I don't know if I can better see this exercise. Please, maybe give me a moment. And then, so try it. Yeah. And I I would like to help. Oh yes, I understand. Just you hear the matter on? Was about really good 27.

Oh, all right, I'm just like kind of you. Put on your best face, just see you as your culture, but unadventurative part of such a tragedy unfold and you do actually surprisingly enough. You actually make your way through the cultists progression because yeah, with the 27, not even guidance terms, you make your way through the crowd.

You and for the record helios guy is walking. Just in front of you does seem to notice but doesn't seem to paid any heat. You do, share, you do hear him go. Yeah, that is exactly what I really the reaction would be what? I mean, I also have medical, what the fuck they're doing.

I'm just gonna continue like also and look just behind him. And look at horror who is now like Anna annoying. Cara are like, it's you an RN, right? And guys does look back and he's sneered at up.

Well it's really windy here. No, Well, I can see that no one's carrying. So it's like Nobody seemed to be this received through the rooms systems, so Walk. We'll do it this way. The progression has made it there. Kadeem and Ira no that's not either it's under just one of us.

That is I'm yeah I think so. It pulled off like here and are pretty much about to be out of side if you wait a few more moments as the progression starts to make their way around. Yeah, can we see the building windows at all just with us enough?

I'll say it this way. I will say, as you kind of start to jockey into position, the precession continues and roughly you gather that from the current angle, they would probably no longer be able to nobody from the procession, would be able to really spy the two of you.

Okay, so you can get to position. Should you choose to? Yeah, I'd like to, like, kind of still like, with the roses and stuff, kind of like be walking by me. Like, what is in there like closer? Ah, I mean, because again, do remember this building is not on ground floor, right?

So you'd be looking all the angle through the windows. Do you know what this building is? You know, idea? I mean, can we see anything? The only thing that you do know about this building is that at some point in time, the cult took it over. You don't really know what that means though.

Yeah. I mean, could we try to like at least look up like from across the street? Like, maybe gleam something from the windows? You can I like to position just a dude in the window. Yeah, okay, yeah, just what kind of like? Yeah. Like, there's something like little like pacing, like a little loop, like, walking around, like, still.

I'm holding him like bank reception. Check as you try and pass by. Yeah, both. Yeah. The DC is high, due to the circumstances, and you can't see through your real tears. Yeah, she rolls a natural one, that's what happens. So, Like anything? Yeah. Kadeem. Doubling over. But taking quick glance, I'm just here.

I'm past each of the windows, you don't soon what you do see is that of the three windows, one of them seems to be illuminated from the inside. It is still, you know, predawn. So it's still pretty dark starting to get lighter, but you can make out very clearly that inside the So sorry, the farthest to the left from my perspective window.

All the way over here is illuminated and you can see what looks to me. Like, some kind of hanging chandelier with a couple of candles that are still lit. Okay, daily whisper to Ira's but he's around there.

I thought, maybe. Justification and I'll finish it. Yeah, maybe we should just catch back up. Maybe I don't want to get called Same. That's right. We that was very convincing. That Yeah. All right, that's all Sony. And do you want to catch back up to them, or Where you want to go?

You and just go back.

We can. Me. Okay. Let's let's okay. All right, you got to show Yeah, almost ketchup. All right. Yeah, we'll catch up. Okay. Like so because you guys did a couple of passes by Sam's. Yeah. The procession. And and at this point in time, at least, that's right. Yeah, the processions made it about here.

Yeah. You all start to try like are you rushing to catch up or a reasonable place? Reason puppies. I mean, we don't want to draw, not trying to draw into four miles an hour as what appears to be and added. The cultists all produced different kinds of instruments and they start playing a very like, macabre, joyous kind of song like as a very deliberate insult to the people of the town and your passing.

By people up the town, they are coming out and watching but not necessarily but they're like they're in their doorways. They're in their windows as you basketball and these cultists start playing a very like pervert. It's like playing a super happy song at a funeral. Oh really like poor taste and you can see them once they start they're smiling and laughing and you can watch helios as all of the guards like instinctively reached words.

They're very visible weapons. And there's like the the person at the head who is, who is wearing another, like very adorned armor like Even himself reaching for his weapon comes around and shoots a very meaningful glare at all the soldiers who seemed very hesitant to go back to their natural stances.

And they continued. I would say this continues on, as you continue to walk.

Kind of like that if it wasn't a meme had this point in time as they get near the front page at this point marriage, balfour, and cowlick, you can start to hear it, hmm. Like I said, be them. Then I would say yes, the two of you here it is.

Well, I'll just even in a normal place. I assume they're probably catching like a dinosaurs precessions. Not going, it's not going super fast. They are catching up but they haven't caught up and was there playing like, an actual Just like a sandsaw try to counter those a little bit.

Okay, first session to make and start forming activity. Could I help him? How do you want to help you? I have bagpipes. Okay. I'm glad. It's a song of me people, which You think I just like the loop? Like I said, well I feel you said Ira also pulls out this way back you with the nod and you also Are not and you kind of do like with your loop, you kind of give up one to three and you start and the wind and answer the five giving it so reflection.

Weaving across the possession, and actually over well. Yeah, overpowering yeah, overpowering. The voltage and kind of slide, it's salting music to the point. That it actually takes all of them by something and stuff.

The cult is performer and the role of one. There's like, absolutely, they were just taken, I don't know. Wait a minute. No one is ever done this before one. So I know they all just like, they all like misstep because they were practically like Don't know how to speak.

I probably not the bagpipers like and The domino not a celebration but like an occasion, the soldiers are marching, the cultists were also doing a kind of mark, but like all be. We're just like as another insult because this like they get off of their off. Term March beat and all of their instruments.

Stop, They keep moving but you Helios you can clearly vibration just have this Wi-Fi Is there like early Chinese scrambling, get themselves sorted out again, immediately All of the guards. There you go. There's a very noticeable like Like manic not manic but like really from what they're waiting to sing.

Yeah. And you see that like even guys like turns over and it's just like dead staring. Each of the cultists in the base, they eventually get themselves sorted out and what they just put their instruments away. Just, we'll talk it up to the fact that the Greeks have never seen a backflip.

So what is that made of? There's so many holes that tubes, the therapy belt or American metallics. Also here this music and immediately, the cultists like stuff stop. And you can see them, they made it out of the city and they are like, turning down the cats, They'll talk about people, It makes me sad.

I'm from the eye, 10 cultists. 20 soldiers and in the center, very visibly visible is a guy as with his blue like cloak and then immediately behind him is the procession of helios, anora and karma, right? All making their way down, slow towards the towards the sacrificial altar, about this point, you better play the other stereotypical goal, happy bagpipe music.

Once we win, I don't know what it's called. We're not we're standing out or I'm standing straight up like they are. Yeah, on the rock helios, you will what's the best perception fifty? Yeah, 50. Yeah, you notice it an order doesn't seem to Cara. Definitely does and so does guidance but you you would actually notice being so close.

That he looks up ceased the three of you and you can see that guys does come and he looks over at you and just gives you like a sneer like, oh, all these people come out to do. And just keeps on walking and at that point Ira and Kelly Kadim.

Sorry, make it out of the city, you see the possession, like the end of the procession making their way down. You see, Merrick, Balfour, and Calic up the cliff and the inverse is true. You all see Ira and catching up to the procession. Yeah. Okay. Got a mediumly favorite move.

Also, instead of me, I'm assuming heliosis sticking with. Yeah, I was like you should so you watch as the, the procession like gets to the river bank guys, immediately just walking out into the river towards the rock and like just starts like hand over fist climbing. You helios Anara and Cara also make their what make your way out to the rock.

You go out first. Yeah, I hope you're well first. You also. I will say since I am going up first, I'll You take my time and make sure that the door doesn't need any help. And if she does all for more help, I can she gets about halfway up before she does start to slip the old But you reach down, there's only enough and you're a very strong individual.

So it's not hard for you to help her all the way up as you get to the top helping an or up. You do see guys there. Like not laughing but looking basically contempting can contemptuous thank you intentionally at an aura. And then you blink in cars there. See, of course, so intense was Here we are.

And he's speaking rather loudly. Even though it doesn't sound like he shouting, his voice does carry. On of sacrifice that has been given this dead. The daughter of Shall die. Here, He looks over at you Leos and I across the bike. But I may be able to make a history, check to see if I can remember why what the typical procession like of these events are making speech to see if we are in fact supposed to get off because I really fuck, that's a tablet.

General procedure are for the sacrifice to be brought by the procession, which is the walk chained to the pole. And then usually Though, this is always kind of up in the air. The culture is never really seemed to care. Usually, everybody leaves the sacrifice there because the basilisks come and everything, that's there, right?

Nobody seems to really say anything about other people being, stupid enough to stand there, okay? But you do, and it's more of a gesture of Step aside all step aside not get okay. I'm that was my misunderstanding. Yeah I will you know yeah and let them do what menorah walks up over to the pole stands before it puts her hands behind her back and you watch as Once again, very impassively diet, starts to use the change to bind her to the pole.

Wow. Goodbye. Where if we start? And he just walks off and drops, like doesn't climb down, just drops lands, that's making his way back. The procession by the way has now white spread an hour out. Once again taking up a formation of cultists soldiers and then the original age like feed into the other groups.

So now it's basically cultists on this side, guards on that side and they're just so the cultists are right below us. Yes. Okay. Like how how far below? Please stop over. Please. Stop it. Okay, so first case well, Awesome. All of you except for Helios, we're currently up on the highest part.

Yeah. So it's about like 20 feet forward and then like a good like 50 feet down. So it's they're not directly below you. They're a little in front and below if that makes sense. All right. At this point guys takes up position. Like my begging man. Like, almost once again, as like a deliberately insult directly in front of the city guards.

With his back to them, just like completely on concern. Just like standing there in front of the city, guards with his back though.

Well brother, I guess we just wait now. That we shall, They'll just reach out and put a comforting hand on her shoulder. Don't only. Nope, I told you I wouldn't believe with you the entire day and I meant it.

Thank you. Of course, gives me courage. Feel kind of. Daughter of about a battle and we can't do anything. As I said, yesterday. Your braver than you think. You hurt.

Okay. You have nothing to worry about, you're in your brother's hand. You put them.

If you'll excuse me, I have some other business. Here is gross and you watches. She walks off and seeing to imitate guys walking off and falling. But instead of falling, she just walks like and like as she walks literally over the soldiers and guys looks down as she passes and walks literally into the city.

Anybody want to do anything?

I hope ready to jump down if there are actually anythings that are going to come out of some water and eat here, but otherwise, no way that egg pipes. The first hour goes by Everybody make perception check. One. Everybody's keeping their eyes peeing. All right. It doesn't matter. 60, right?

This is fucking themes night, baby. What did your role, get? Married nine. Okay. Helios spell for cadem and calic. You all notice a couple of things. After the first hour, first, you notice that yes has made his way is making his way back to the sacrificial long term. Also notice that a long This edge over here.

Hmm. This is ours, no, you notice the appearance of what a beer up that the appearance of 12 centers who take up positions kind of a long this inside. That's the wrong place. Along this edge, they take a position. They stop at the same time guys. Makes it back up the off the rock.

Just in time to watch the show. So this is and to keep anybody think they'd be citronics? And, Mm-hmm. I don't know what you mean. Yeah, you're right. And I'm sure you don't. My favorite will be the same as a Norris.

Guys, I care so much.

If anything goes down, I think we should get down there in a flash. Despite normally being composed all adults, say at the continued insults, go on with you say the words and we'll make it, we'll make it so but otherwise still there watching great. Headers Indeed. How far away are we from the rock except myself?

Okay, so you're about 50 feet but no, okay. Yeah, 20 20 feet over 50 feet plus 20 feet over and 50 feet up from here. Yeah. And then it's about like another 20 feet towards the base of the rock and the rock was about easier. Am I within 60 feet?

Is what I've what I really want to do well by that, that definition. Yeah, yes. Well, no because it well, what? What? Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Hold on. Yeah, because the elevation is the well the elevation is 10 higher. Now, the rock is 20 feet from level. You were 50 feet from level so it's a 30 feet 30.

Yeah. Right. Yeah 30 feet high and 20 and 20. So 14 40. So it's 40. 40 views. But diagrams there. Yeah. Would you be like 45s? Yeah, I'm pretty. I'm pretty sure that would be winning 60. Yeah, I'm pretty sure like 55 right at 60. Yeah, you are within the 60, right?

So using my amazing mascot, I just wanted to Like I see them just kind of. Yeah, I just wanted, I want to inspire you. Okay, so pretty, you have like a little thing. You know what? I'm gonna fucking ball. Actually, I wasn't gonna fucking. Why would you already there?

Think. At this point, like,

Yeah, his insights is not very I'm just so bored. Watch that. Is it for me? It was 20. Oh yeah, it's 20. Yeah yeah. Destination. Of course, God's not treacherous. They're not the only ones. He's just finished.

Hilliard was really has no response. One guy says, I don't know what he? He's really just kind of dumbfounded about 50. Exactly right. 50 is the answer. The next hour goes by actually, I should have been able to tell. It's a three, four, five, just, yeah, that's right. The next hour goes by.

I don't remember what that is. So we are now We'll say roughly an hour passed on. Mm-hmm. Okay. Started to make it easier any bubbling. Make perception check if you want to. And I hope you said bubbling I thought you said bumbling. I'm like huh? These are 50 degrees.

Hello please. Six five twice. You don't see anything new. Well, I'm sure we all remake checks or oh, yeah, I as long as people are watching, hey, Austin state of, hey, don't you give me your bad weather? It wasn't even for me. I assumed in fairness, I probably am a little bit more preoccupied because watching guys and make sure he doesn't try anything you can also just stand.

Yeah, in the meta today, did they specify exactly that it had to be the fucking creatures? Well, I mean for from what at least Haley is I believe had known about it. It the sacrifice was always done by the bass. It was. Okay. Yeah. And from couple but the fact that I told you is sacrifices always offered to the vassalists as representatives of syndrome and the the sacrifice to fulfill the quota.

The sacrifice must be on the altar from dawn, until dusk got it. Now it makes into dusk because the best listen I need it. Right? And that's meta from what you had that you talked about pythons. Like, that's what, yeah, that's what I thought was. Just maybe what python or five sizes?

Five sessions ago that was yesterday, right. Yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah. That's one of those we things, you know. So we had a busy day. We jumped forward the next five hours go by without it. Yeah. Okay. It was two hours, past dawn, and then five hours. So second hours passed on would be I don't know what exactly Well it depends on season.

It is. It's so cold summer that it probably don't like seven probably savings time because look, don't bring that into my fantasy world that's all okay. So we're seven hours packages. Yeah, two o'clock. Okay. So I'm having another say six and a half. Okay. So I mean we don't have to like actually do anything but periodically you know I will be speaking with a norm making sure you still doing all right.

Now she seems to be Oddly enough. And to, to what you can tell is the annoyance Not enough to make him say or do anything, but the general irritation of guys on all the door is being is becoming more and more caught and more and more confident and less worried.

And you can tell that it annoys guys. I'm sure. He doesn't say are doing anything. He you can just see like every now and then just a little Like irritated, like Like muscle spasm of like I have a noise me, you can't do anything about it and I have no reason to because I don't really win.

What I'm annoyed by your attitude burning. All right. All right. The next three hours go by now at five o'clock. There is a very audible, Sorry. Yeah. Very audible that. Oh, Oh, that's yeah you do helios. You notice this does also seem to take guys by surprise as everybody starts to look around you all very visibly, see what appear to be five harpies descent from the sky well and like take up positions around the altar.

Helios, you can definitely.

We're 50 feet away. So well is is things. Really harpies are like the whatever. Okay yeah and Kadeem can't even swim. Pretty sure you're old say otherwise. Up to you. And I'm just See you guys, did you say that's whatever shock and surprise that Tommy slows doggy panel more Like confusion, like, what are they doing?

What's your best for like four minutes? It's time, you know, but he seems, they're writing them three minutes. He doesn't seem to recognize, He is confused as to their presence and recognizes them in his confused, but not concerned which definitely doesn't vote rightfully. I do like a history on like, Herpes, like in the, you know, make history, just try it out with him because I've got something kind of just bounce ideas off each other.

You did go to university. Didn't go to school. Only from music though, mostly producing one. Maybe there's a song about the heartbeats maybe, you know what? I love. That's a story. Yeah, the ballad there's something. The ballot of Curtis Harpy, 19, it's good talking way could demon Kadin, you start kind of running through some of the lyrics of songs that involve harpies and like their use in placement in theming in representation and what sparks your memory is?

One of the the songs, these heartbeats not particularly seen in the area due to their black feathers, these harpies in particular. Black feather ones have always been linked with sorry. Yes. Yes, like that. Which I would know. And these being, Some of her. Want to say main but like most recognizable minions of Lou Ferrigno Okay, specifically these Unusually black feathered parties, as normally their wing, feathers, are more of a brown and light tan due to the season and the climate, but these harpies.

Having black feathers are always linked whether it entails song. Yeah, this is a visual accounts whether true or not you're not sure as being tied to with area, got it. Okay? Okay. This shortbread during some of that waiting I'll give you that because you're not taking any actions. You are basically just sitting and waiting.

Watching waiting commiserating. Yeah, waiting. Oh, there is not good. But I don't know what's happening. Should move down. I don't know if they're going to attack or not. Origin of those in case. We have to do. Okay, I assume I will also with the history check. I made earlier be able to recognize that this is definitely not normal.

This is not long. You can also, I would yeah. Well I guess I didn't recognize the chocolate. Yeah, so the history you did before and guys is reaction, you know, this is not normal and it's not probably planned. At least as far as diocese away, fair enough. Yeah, because you're just gonna probably walk keep it now.

Especially watch the lie. Yeah. So start moving. Yeah. Well, in in the meta, wouldn't that mean? We would have to lose our line of sight to them? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not a fan out that. Yeah, right. I'd rather call crawl down or feather fall down. I do not want to lose our line of sight or one second.

Yeah. Know. I mean in fairness I think you all pretty much have something ranged. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's what the only one that truly needs to be in melee. Ranges on the rock. Yeah. Where you're supposed to be like, right? Where? You're so yeah. But fireballs, only 20 and I need 50 so brother, do not fire but kill everybody.

Okay, I know what You're just doing it on purpose, but come on baby. You know what if you want to fireball, go for it. Let's see what happens. I want to see what happens too that actually. Yeah. Me no one 120 questions. Okay. Yeah. Long short brass, whatever during the time can I do a clear voice?

I get a spell at short long breasts. Yeah. Can I do like, kind of trying to do it suddenly? So I mean, this the thing you created is invisible, right? Yes. But me I don't have to do. Yeah. Like most for in medical I say from what you can tell.

Nobody can see. Yeah. Outside of possibly guys. It's just a big yes. Since you're a 50 foot on a cliff and it's also, you can also stand behind. Yeah. I think just I'll just stand in front of you. Yeah. I'll we'll both stand and run the yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know we're just like hey at seven to it because Ira and calico are pretty big and they're just like he's real when that real quick I kind of just blames down quick is there a change in posture for any of the city guards with the arrival?

Look you do you have advantage? You've looked down and you said that was not herpes arrived literally all of them have to do it. Yeah I don't know what you got. It's how big bad yeah to 16, isn't it about seven. Plus three more actual Jesus. All right, 16, trying to do is the role is the viral, six of them have drawn swords.

I don't know if you race spirit. Well, I think it replaces you replacing any attack role saving through or ability check combination like Warhammer it's just you die. So you still get to endure shit like we're you're welcome. There's a reason I'm around and you for doors to see that fucking lucky, right?

Focused on the culture, lucky there, I assumed the bowman and various turning lucky shows. They had no Yes. Very noticeably like because we can see it all. Yeah, it's looking guys, you know, because they're longer weapons named kind of made like almost a tea to the line where they're just like.

Yeah. Feet is not fun. Yeah. Because 50 feet is the length for the house. This is like, yeah. So it's like can you see from one another the house of the other? Yes, very easily. Right? The cultists haven't made a move, right, but they also do kind of have that.

I didn't even probably similar to guy is yes they're like that's different. Yeah. Okay, so yeah. So thanks America over here is 26. All right on yourself. Yeah. Oh no. Yeah, he's 60 dead. So yeah you have to cash, right? Oh, let's see. For that record. The 12th centaur are still there.

They have not moved since they appeared there are over here, right? Yes, they lined up. They haven't done anything. They haven't drawn weapons. They just all stood there. Can I put it about here probably along like in line with the rock about 20 feet up? Yeah. So kind of keeping it between them and them.

Yep. And I'd like to do the gearing version, okay? So I can hear everything is if I was there or not. So really this was there. Um, and the last 10 minutes, all right, it's an action switch between them. Okie dokie twice. So you complete your casting and the first thing that catches your ears is a voice that does not sound like helios Anora or guidance from that direction over here with them in the rock or front of the direction of the center.

Okay? From the center to the center. Here's like, what is that? What I would like to pull out. I don't know if Greeks would know what a backpack. One is closer. Maybe like you see it the damage to the sidewinder versus the dragon. There's like oh boy. Oh no, I did not.

See all the look that I will show you. It's so funny. If you can see data secrets, I mean, from the wording of the spell, kind of makes it seem like you just kind of taken extra ear and just like, to throw it out there, like, you're still here.

It's just like, yeah. Yeah. Right. So, it's like, deciding to focus on the left side of your hair here, it doesn't set it. All right, your senses, like walking through from your right, right? And yeah.

I'm very kind of say a lot, you know, it was voice right. That captain north said, the centers you're there for scouting, but they're not sure why or what's happening here for the record cheating. Thank you. Those of the one. Oh so we can wrestling still. You know not he's here.

Yeah so he wanted to watch. Yeah, she wasn't. Achieve this arm wrestle me bro. Okay keep my wave there. Yeah. Fun, I wasn't for anything else. Nothing else seems to happen, helios. The only thing that you notice is that guesses You know, efficiently over my man like, what's happening.

All righty. So let me just the quick claim. And so what would I be able to see far over to where the the cave entrances? Is that's your color. I mean, you can see in that direction, it's very far. I'm pretty sure this point that's like over my, it's like yeah.

Okay, if you had somebody else's special eyes. No, that's still. Now on this table anyway. So The next couple hours go by, we slowly come to about 8:30. The sun is set. Yeah, I'm now more so than ever. I would say that hilliers is in He still just standing there at the moment, but it also like sort of the ready action at a moment's notice if especially the harpies is what I'm worried about if they try to do anything.

I'm gonna have shield out in being in front of them. Yeah. So you draw your, you know, I don't draw anything. Yeah. Like taking the right. Yeah, you take a position and you get yourself ready. And you see guys like I you up and down. But not really like room and then looks out in towards the river.

Then very deliberately looks at the sky and watches the last couple of minutes. The size of. Slow sense. Do you think it's in bad form to flip them off? Yeah. Okay, you can't hear me. Yeah, yeah. We hit just

Three things happen. Okay, she first came here. I'm very audible.

Yeah, coming from second immediately upon Dust officially kick all the harpies screech and fly towards Aurora. Yeah, make her action. All right, so yeah, for now it's just shield out and interpose myself. She filled out an approach yourself. I don't know if I would have time to do this at the moment, since it was more of a reaction type thing.

But if I can I would also like, to shield the herpes, just again, for a little bit extra protection more than happy. My body. Any, this was not the deal. So the third thing that happened a blue light appears beside guys. As you watch, is he draws from noon.

There it is. This is large. Like the freaking great sword, we've heard at the edge blowing blue as he makes me killing her to attacks on two of the heartbeats. Whoa, okay let's not and so he's slices through each of them. Yeah. Like not just slicing like as the blade cuts through the bodies, like seem to like crush and then explode backwards as like the two bodies are flown out immediately.
